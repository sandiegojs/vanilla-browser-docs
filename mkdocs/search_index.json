It will automatically be installed when you install node.\n\n\nNPM installs packages \nlocally\n (within the directory it is invoked in) for per-project modules, or \nglobally\n for packages you want accessible everywhere.\n\n\nHowever, by default NPM installs global packages in a root-restricted location, requiring SUDO to install.  This creates a \nhuge\n headache.  As an alternative, \nbefore\n you install any packages, follow \nthis guide\n to configure your NPM to install in your home directory without requiring sudo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone this repository \ngit clone git@github.com:sandiegojs/vanilla-browser-workshop.git\n\n\nChange directories into the workshop folder: \ncd vanilla-browser-workshop\n and install your local dependencies with: \nnpm install\n\n\nInstall these global dependencies using the \n-g\n flag (ex \nnpm install \npackage\n -g\n)\n\n\ngulp\n\n\nmocha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you plan to deploy your app onto Heroku, setup \nHeroku Toolbelt\n\n\n\n\nAPI service\n\n\nThe app we will be building is a client-side application, meaning it will be running in a user's browser. We will need to persist the data that we are\ncreating to a backend service and database so that we can recall it later.\n\n\nWe could use fixture data or a mock service for this, but some friendly backend\ndevelopers have already made a working API for us, so let's use that.\n\n\nOur API is setup at \n//sandiegojs-vanilla-workshop.herokuapp.com\n and supports the following endpoints\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nVerb\npath\nDescription\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nGET\n/forms\nList of forms\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nPOST\n/forms\nCreate a new form\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nGET\n/forms/:id\nRetrieve a form\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nPUT\n/forms/:id\nUpdate a form\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nDELETE\n/forms/:id\nDelete a form\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nThis project uses the build tool [Gulp][gulp] to automate a bunch of stuff for you.

If you look at the \napp/index.html\n you will see that our email field is currently setup as a \ntype='text'\n. Go ahead and change it.\n\n\nOnce you have, we can test it out. Head over to the browser, type in a \nName\n value (so that we don't get the required error) and type in a phoney string that doesn't look like an email address. Once you hit submit, you should see a nice message come up and tell you that your input doesn't look like an email.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about validations that are available for inputs, \nMDN has a great article covering the details\n.\n\n\nThe DOM\n\n\nThe Document Object Model(DOM) is how we are able to interact with our page via JavaScript. The DOM is a representation of what is on the page, including the elements and styles.\n\n\n\n\nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents. It provides a structured representation of the document (a tree) and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once that event is triggered the event handlers get executed. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages. -\nMDN\n\n\n\n\nOne of the trickest things about the DOM is that it's up to the browser vendor to implement it and therefore every implementation is a little different. This is why we get browser compatability issues.\n\n\nBut as you will see there is a large API exposed by the DOM which allows us to craft powerful user experiences. An easy way to think of the DOM is a tree of nested nodes and each node is an element from our HTML document, e.g. a \ndiv\n, \np\n, \nbutton\n, etc...\n\n\nTo visualize this all you need to do is open your web inspector and look at the \nElements\n tab to see this structure realized. Each one of those nodes (elements) has many properties and functions you can take advantage off.\n\n\n\n\nDOM selection\n\n\nIn order to interact with the DOM within JavaScript, the first thing you will need to understand is element selection. If you're familiar with a library such as \njQuery\n or \nZepto\n than you'll be used to doing this by way of the \n$()\n selector. By selecting an element (DOM node) we get a reference to that element which allows us to take actions on it.\n\n\nThere are several functions we can use to get a reference to a DOM node. Overtime these functions have been introduced to solve different needs. As such, the browser support for them can vary. You should always research browser compatability to ensure they will work for your user base.\n\n\n\n\nquerySelector\n\n\nquerySelectorAll\n\n\ngetElementById\n\n\ngetElementsByClassName\n\n\ngetElementsByName\n\n\ngetElementsByTagName\n\n\n\n\nFor now, we are going to focus on \nquerySelector\n. This function behaves similar to jQuery in that it allows you to specify a \ncss selector\n that will be used to find the first matching node. One of the nice feature of this function is that it is available both on the \ndocument\n as well as \nelement\n. This means you can search for an element in the entire document or narrow your search to the sub elements of an existing element.\n\n\nFor now, let's just open up the dev console and mess around. In Chrome OSX this can be accomplished with the keyboard shortcut \nCommand + Option + j\n or \nCommand + Option + i\n and \nControl + Shift + j\n on Windows. We can begin by selecting the input with a name attribute of \nname\n.\n\n\nvar inputName = document.querySelector('input[name=\nname\n]')\n\n\n\n\nThis sets the variable inputName to an \nHTMLInputElement\n which has a \nvalue\n property available. Go ahead and set the value property to see an example of how you can change the DOM.\n\n\ninputName.value = 'My new value!'\n\n\n\n\nYou should see the value you set reflected in the form's input.\n\n\nWhenever dealing with a DOM node it's important to understand what type of element you have and what are it's parents. That will determine the properties and functions available to you.\n\n\nEvent handling\n\n\nWhen users interact with the web page the DOM publishes these interactions as events, for example \nclick\n, \nscroll\n, \nkeypress\n, and \nmore\n.\n\n\nAfter selecting an element from the DOM, we can call it's \naddEventListener\n method which will execute a callback function we provide any time that event occurs. Lets start by listening for a \nclick\n on the \ndocument\n and trigger an \nalert\n whenever that event occurs.\n\n\nWe are going to keep working in the dev console for now, and continue to mess around. Once we get the hang of event handlers, we can start building our app. But for now, let's just keep using the dev console.\n\n\nvar handler = function() {\n  alert('user clicked on the page')\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', handler)\n\n\n\n\nNow if you click on the page you should receive an alert with your message. Alerting users every time they click the page can get annoying so lets remove that event listener.\n\n\ndocument.removeEventListener('click', handler)\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to note that in order for us to be able to remove an event listener we need to name our functions so we can specify what to remove for that event.\n\n\nUsing this simple API we can trigger the complex logic we will be writing shortly.\n\n\nMultiple event listeners\n\n\nOne of the great things about event listeners is that we can attach multiple listeners per event. For example:\n\n\nvar handlerOne = function() {\n  // Do some logic\n}\n\nvar handlerTwo = function() {\n  // Do some logic\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', handlerOne)\ndocument.addEventListener('click', handlerTwo)\n\n\n\n\nNow both of these functions will be executed whenever someone clicks the page.\n\n\nEvent listener parameter\n\n\nWhen we attach callback functions to events these functions are passed as an event argument. The type of event given will change depending on the type input device which triggered it. Since we are listening for a \nclick\n event we will receive a \nMouseEvent\n.\n\n\nvar logEvent = function(evt) {\n  console.log(evt)\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', logEvent)\n\n\n\n\nIf you inspect this event in the console you will see there are quite a few properties available to us. The ones most commonly used are \ntarget\n and \ncurrentTarget\n.\n\n\ntarget\n is the element who dispatched the event.\n\n\ncurrentTarget\n is the element who handled the event during the event capture (a.k.a bubbling) phase.\n\n\nAlthough important, we won't dive into the distinction between these two just yet. For our purposes we are going to use the \ncurrentTarget\n event to always get a reference to the element who has the event listener listening for the event.",

If you're familiar with a library such as  jQuery  or  Zepto  than you'll be used to doing this by way of the  $()  selector. By selecting an element (DOM node) we get a reference to that element which allows us to take actions on it.  There are several functions we can use to get a reference to a DOM node. Overtime these functions have been introduced to solve different needs. As such, the browser support for them can vary. You should always research browser compatability to ensure they will work for your user base.   querySelector  querySelectorAll  getElementById  getElementsByClassName  getElementsByName  getElementsByTagName   For now, we are going to focus on  querySelector . This function behaves similar to jQuery in that it allows you to specify a  css selector  that will be used to find the first matching node. One of the nice feature of this function is that it is available both on the  document  as well as  element . This means you can search for an element in the entire document or narrow your search to the sub elements of an existing element.  For now, let's just open up the dev console and mess around. In Chrome OSX this can be accomplished with the keyboard shortcut  Command + Option + j  or  Command + Option + i  and  Control + Shift + j  on Windows. We can begin by selecting the input with a name attribute of  name .  var inputName = document.querySelector('input[name= name ]')  This sets the variable inputName to an  HTMLInputElement  which has a  value  property available. Go ahead and set the value property to see an example of how you can change the DOM.  inputName.value = 'My new value!'  You should see the value you set reflected in the form's input.  Whenever dealing with a DOM node it's important to understand what type of element you have and what are it's parents. That will determine the properties and functions available to you.",

Lets start by listening for a  click  on the  document  and trigger an  alert  whenever that event occurs.  We are going to keep working in the dev console for now, and continue to mess around. Once we get the hang of event handlers, we can start building our app. But for now, let's just keep using the dev console.  var handler = function() {\n  alert('user clicked on the page')\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', handler)  Now if you click on the page you should receive an alert with your message. Alerting users every time they click the page can get annoying so lets remove that event listener.  document.removeEventListener('click', handler)  It's important to note that in order for us to be able to remove an event listener we need to name our functions so we can specify what to remove for that event.

Later, we'll use this handler to kick off a request to the backend.\n\n\nOur first step in this new file is to get a reference to the form element. Create a variable named \nform\n, and assign the form DOM element on the page to it.\n\n\nvar form = document.querySelector('form')\n\n\n\n\nOn the next line create a \nsubmitHandler\n function. We will need to have the event passed into the handler available to us so add the parameter \nevt\n to the function declaration.\n\n\nvar submitHandler = function(evt) {}\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using the \npreventDefault\n method on the event object. This handy method will stop the form from submitting to the backend so that we can submit this information using AJAX.\n\n\nLet's also throw in an \nalert\n so that we can see some feedback from the submit handler. Otherwise, when we click on the submit button nothing will happen which can be confusing. Add the two new commands to the submit handler declaration like below.\n\n\nvar submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  alert('submit!')\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn order to hook this handler up to our form element, we will need to use the \naddEventListener\n method that exists on the form node. Pass in the event we want to listen for \nsubmit\n as well as the custom handler we just wrote.\n\n\nform.addEventListener('submit', submitHandler)\n\n\n\n\nNow if you refresh the page you should be able to submit the form after filling out the two required fields, but instead of the page refreshing and losing everything you've entered the page will show you an alert and you won't lose any of the information you typed.\n\n\nOur event handler is now working!\n\n\nSerialize the form data\n\n\nBefore we can begin to assemble the pieces for talking to our server, we will need to make sure that we can capture the data from our form in a format that our API endpoint can digest. The API for this workshop is built with \nrails-api\n which will be expecting a JSON API object on the request.\n\n\nWe need to take the form data and convert it to an object that looks like this\n\n\n{\n  \nform\n: {\n    \nname\n: \n,\n    \nemail\n: \n,\n    \ncity\n: \n,\n    \nstate\n: \n,\n    \ngithub\n: \n,\n    \ntwitter\n: \n,\n    \nbio\n: \n,\n    \nskills_attributes\n: []\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf we were using something like jQuery we may use the \n.serializeArray()\n method. Let's write our own \nserializeArray\n method.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {}\n\n\n\n\nWe want to be able to pass in our selector for the form to this method and get the JSON object back. First, let's use \ndocument.querySelector\n again to grab the form.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n}\n\n\n\n\nProTip\u2122:\n  In our example, we know we are passing in a form selector but if you wanted to use this method in a different scenario, you might want to check that the element we have selected is actually a form by using \nform.tagName\n to check the element's tag name.\n\n\nNow we need to grab all the inputs from inside the form element. Remember the \nquerySelectorAll\n method mentioned above? While \nquerySelector\n returns a single Node in the DOM, \nquerySelectorAll\n will return a \nNodeList\n.\n\n\nThe unusual thing about this is that \nNodeList\n is not a JavaScript \nArray\n and so we cannot use methods like \nmap\n or \nforEach\n to iterate over the items returned. We could do some fancy work and add these methods to the prototype for \nNodeList\n, but to keep things simple we will just use a basic \nfor\n loop to iterate over them.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input,textarea')\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \n formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow that we can iterate over them we will need to store the \nname\n and \nvalue\n of each item onto a JSON object as the \nkey\n,\nvalue\n pair. When we are accessing the \nNode\n directly, we can easily call \nnode.name\n or \nnode.value\n to access these attributes.\n\n\nWe can't test our method unless we call our \nserializeArray\n method from somewhere, so let's add the call into our \nsubmitHandler\n method.\n\n\nvar submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  var data = serializeArray('form')\n}\n\n\n\n\nOk, now let's build our final \ndata\n JSON object. Let's also log it to the console so that we can inspect it make sure it matches our expected output that we defined above.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input,textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \n formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n    data[item.name] = item.value\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reload the page and submit the form again, you should see something similar to this outputted in the console.\n\n\n\n\nWell that looks \nnearly\n correct. Can you spot the problems?\n\n\nFirstly, we're capturing the submit button. There are a couple ways to avoid this.\n\n\nWe could change the submit button from an \ninput\n to a \ndiv\n and change our handler from the \nform\n \nsubmit\n event to the \ndiv\n \nonclick\n event. If we were to do this, we would lose the native validations, so let's nix this idea.\n\n\nWe could instead just change our \nquerySelectorAll(...)\n selector string to ignore the \ntype=submit\n input. That seems simple enough, so let's add that in.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input:not([type=submit]),textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \n formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n    data[item.name] = item.value\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}\n\n\n\n\nOk, let's try this again!\n\n\n\n\nSomething is still off. Did you spot it?\n\n\nWe need our \nskills_attributes\n key to have an array value since we have multiple skills. Right now, only the very last skill is being saved. We want to catch this special case inside of our \nfor\n loop. If we haven't created this new \nskills_attributes\n array, do so and append the current skill, and if we have then just append the current skill.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input:not([type=submit]),textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \n formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n\n    if (item.name === 'skills_attributes') {\n      if (!!data[item.name]) {\n        data[item.name].push(item.value)\n      } else {\n        data[item.name] = [item.value]\n      }\n    } else {\n      data[item.name] = item.value\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}\n\n\n\n\nHead back over to the console, and you'll see our data now looks correct! Our last step is to remove the \nconsole.log\n and replace it with a return statement that returns an object with a \nform\n property set to our data, since this is the structure our API endpoint is expecting.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input:not([type=submit]),textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \n formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n\n    if (item.name === 'skills_attributes') {\n      if (!!data[item.name]) {\n        data[item.name].push(item.value)\n      } else {\n        data[item.name] = [item.value]\n      }\n    } else {\n      data[item.name] = item.value\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    \nform\n: data\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBuild XHR and submit\n\n\nNow that we have our data we need to send it to the server using an XHR or \nXMLHttpRequest\n. This allows us to communicate with the server without changing pages, and then do some action based on the data we get back. We are going to create a function that we can put in our event handlers that will do this.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {}\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we create a new instance of XHR.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext we'll use \nopen(method, path, async)\n to initialize the request.\n\n\n\n\nmethod:\n a string of an HTTP method to use, such as 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'. This will match the Verb on the API table up top.\n\n\npath:\n a string of the full path to send the request to. This will include the API endpoint URL as well as the path.\n\n\nasync:\n a boolean flag that dictates whether the script should run asynchronously.\n\n\n\n\nProTip\u2122:\n \nasync\n should always be \ntrue\n to prevent blocking. Stopping JavaScript execution especially hurts time sensitive things like rendering or event listening/handling.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n}\n\n\n\n\nBecause we'll be using a JSON endpoint any requests we make to it should contain a \nContent-Type\n header.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n}\n\n\n\n\nXHR only has one event we care to listen to and that's \nonreadystatechange\n.\n\n\nThe ready state of the XHR will change a few times, but we are looking for the last state of \n4\n which is triggered when the request operation is complete.\n\n\nWe'll also check to make sure we got a good server response. If it passes those checks, we'll parse the response JSON, then send the object back though a callback.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n  request.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    // ignore anything that isn't the last state\n    if (request.readyState !== 4) { return }\n\n    // if we didn't get a \ngood\n status such as 200 OK or 201 Created send back an error\n    if (request.readyState === 4 \n (request.status !== 200 \n request.status !== 201)) {\n      callback(new Error('XHR Failed: ' + path), null)\n    }\n\n    // return our server data\n    callback(null, JSON.parse(request.responseText))\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLastly we will use \nJSON.stringify\n to convert our object to a JSON string and send the request with our data using the \nsend\n function.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n  request.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    // ignore anything that isn't the last state\n    if (request.readyState !== 4) { return }\n\n    // if we didn't get a \ngood\n status such as 200 OK or 201 Created send back an error\n    if (request.readyState === 4 \n (request.status !== 200 \n request.status !== 201)) {\n      callback(new Error('XHR Failed: ' + path), null)\n    }\n\n    // return our server data\n    callback(null, JSON.parse(request.responseText))\n  }\n  request.send(JSON.stringify(data))\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow we're ready to use it inside of our \nsubmitHandler\n. We can call it with the 'POST' method and pass it the form data.\n\n\nvar apiURL = '//sandiegojs-vanilla-workshop.herokuapp.com'\n\nvar submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  var path = apiURL + '/forms'\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) { throw err }\n    console.log(data)\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\nHandle server response\n\n\nCongratulations! We can now submit the form to the server and get a response. Now let's do something with the response.\n\n\nWe're going to write any errors from our XHR request to the screen. We're also going to render the contents of the form to the screen if it was successfully submitted.\n\n\nSome of the methods we'll be using are:\n\n\n\n\nDocument.createElement\n this method creates a DOM element of the type specified in the first parameter. For example, we can pass in \ndiv\n, \np\n, \nul\n, etc.\n\n\nDocument.createTextNode\n this method creates a text node that can be placed in the document. We'll use this to hold content we author.\n\n\nNode.appendChild\n this method can be called on any element created using createElement. As you can guess from the name it adds the node passed in to the end of node you call appendChild on.\n\n\n\n\nLet's create a small helper function. It creates a DOM node and adds some text to it. We're going to be making a lot calls to this.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {}\n\n\n\n\nRight inside of that function declaration we should add a call to \ndocument.createElement\n.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext up we will create a text node that will hold whatever is inside of the tagContent variable.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen we combine the two freshly created nodes. You can add other HTML nodes or text nodes to a node even if the HTML node would usually have children, such as \nbr\n.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n  node.appendChild(textNode)\n}\n\n\n\n\nThere is a possibility that when we call this function we won't have any textContent, and calling \ndocument.createTextNode\n without textContent will cause an error. To avoid this kind of error wrap the creation and insertion of the textNode in a conditional test for textContent.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n  if (tagContent) {\n    var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n    node.appendChild(textNode)\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly we will return the node we created with a child text node.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n  if (tagContent) {\n    var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n    node.appendChild(textNode)\n  }\n  return node\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have that built, we can start to output some content. First create the renderError function\n\n\nvar renderError = function(error) {}\n\n\n\n\nThe error render will be very simple. We are going to get a reference to the response container, create a node with our helper function, add a custom class to it, and append it to the document.\n\n\nvar renderError = function(error) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n  var errorNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', error.toString())\n  errorNode.className = 'error'\n  responseNode.appendChild(errorNode)\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow it's time to create the renderFormData function. This function is going to create many DOM nodes and append them to the response container.\n\n\nvar renderFormData = function(data) {}\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing we want to do inside of the renderFormData function is get a reference to the response container just like in our \nrenderError\n function.\n\n\nvar renderFormData = function(data) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's create a generic success message so we can see on screen when the form was submitted and the backend saved it.\n\n\nvar renderFormData = function(data) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n\n  //generic success message\n  var successNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', 'You\\'ve add a new card')\n  successNode.className = 'success'\n  responseNode.appendChild(successNode)\n}\n\n\n\n\nGreat, now we can give some kind of feedback to the user when the form is successfully processed by backend or not. Let's improve upon this, though. Let's show the information we entered when we submitted so we can verify it saved properly.\n\n\nTo do this we'll create a dictionary list, and fill it with all the some of the information that is returned by the request.\n\n\nLet's use the \ndocument.createElement\n method to create a DL node that will hold all those terms and definitions. Append this to the \nrenderFormData\n function.\n\n\nvar dictionaryNode = document.createElement('dl')\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to add some terms and definitions. Let's use the \ncreateElementWithTextNode\n helper function to streamline the process of printing out the name. Add the next couple of lines after the \ndictionaryNode\n variable declaration and assignment.\n\n\n//create a dom node with the name of a value\nvar termNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'name')\ndictionaryNode.appendChild(termNode)\n\n//create another dom node with the value\nvar definitionNode = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data.name)\ndictionaryNode.appendChild(definitionNode)\n\n\n\n\nNow, after the success message we're printing out the name we entered on the form. This response would be more useful if we showed more information. It would be good to show the name, email, and some other attributes. The simplest way to do this is to just copy and paste the code we just wrote and swap out name for email, github, etc.\n\n\nBut, there's a better way. If we create a list of keys we'd like to show on screen, we can loop through them with the native \nforEach\n method of an array. This method will iterate over an array and call a passed in callback function for each item in the array. The first parameter of the callback will be the current item that forEach is iterating through.\n\n\nCreate an array called keys. Place it just after the insertion of the success message, but keep it before the last set of statements we wrote.\n\n\nvar keys = ['name', 'email', 'github', 'twitter', 'city', 'state', 'bio']\n\n\n\n\nNext call the \nforEach\n method on it and pass in an \nanonymous function\n with a single parameter of \nkey\n.\n\n\nkeys.forEach(function(key) {})\n\n\n\n\nMove the name definition and insertion we wrote earlier into the callback. Change the text passed into \ncreateElementWithTextNode\n. For the first call replace the string literal, \n'name'\n with the variable \nkey\n, and for the second call replace \ndata.name\n with \ndata[key]\n. This will allow each iteration to print the current key, such as name or email, as the dictionary term and the actual value, such as \"John Doe\", will be the dictionary definition.\n\n\nkeys.forEach(function(key) {\n  //create a dom node with the name of a value\n  var termNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', key)\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(termNode)\n\n  //create another dom node with the value\n  var definitionNode = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data[key])\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(definitionNode)\n})\n\n\n\n\nIf you review the array of keys we're looping through, you'll notice we didn't include \nskills_attributes\n like we did when we posted the data. That's because the content of that property is more complex than the simple strings of the other properties. If we want to print them out we'll have to write some custom logic.\n\n\nCreate a new dictionary term node like we do in the \nforEach\n callback, but set the text content to \"skills\".\n\n\nvar skillsTermNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'skills')\ndictionaryNode.appendChild(skillsTermNode)\n\n\n\n\nLet's add the dictionary definition, now. We'll add the actual skills information in the next step. We'll show all the skills as a list, so let's also add a \nUL\n node as well and store a reference to it in a variable so we can add \nLI\n elements to it later.\n\n\nvar skillsDefinitionNode = document.createElement('dd')\nvar skillsList = document.createElement('ul')\nskillsDefinitionNode.appendChild(skillsList)\ndictionaryNode.appendChild(skillsDefinitionNode)\n\n\n\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's loop through each skill we received, if any, and combine them into one dictionary definition. To accomplish this we'll test to see if there is any value stored in \nskills_attributes\n. If there is then we can loop through all the skills by using the \nforEach\n method to loop through each complex element in the array and append a simpler set of information to the dictionary. In our case, we'll append only the description of each skill wrapped in a \nLI\n tag.\n\n\nif (data.skills_attributes) {\n  data.skills_attributes.forEach(function (skill) {\n    var skillNode = createElementWithTextNode('li', skill.description)\n    skillsList.appendChild(skillNode)\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe last steps are to add a custom class of \nresponse\n and append the dictionaryNode we've been populating to the responseNode from the beginning of the function. Here is the entire \nrenderFormData\n function:\n\n\nvar renderFormData = function(data) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n\n  //generic success message\n  var successNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', 'You\\'ve add a new card')\n  successNode.className = 'success'\n  responseNode.appendChild(successNode)\n\n  var dictionaryNode = document.createElement('dl')\n  var keys = ['name', 'email', 'github', 'twitter', 'city', 'state', 'bio']\n  keys.forEach(function(key) {\n    //create a dom node with the name of a value\n    var termNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', key)\n    dictionaryNode.appendChild(termNode)\n\n    //create another dom node with the value\n    var definitionNode = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data[key])\n    dictionaryNode.appendChild(definitionNode)\n  })\n\n  var skillsTermNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'skills')\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(skillsTermNode)\n\n  var skillsDefinitionNode = document.createElement('dd')\n  var skillsList = document.createElement('ul')\n  skillsDefinitionNode.appendChild(skillsList)\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(skillsDefinitionNode)\n\n  if (data.skills_attributes) {\n    data.skills_attributes.forEach(function (skill) {\n      var skillNode = createElementWithTextNode('li', skill.description)\n      skillsList.appendChild(skillNode)\n    })\n  }\n\n  dictionaryNode.className = 'response'\n  responseNode.appendChild(dictionaryNode)\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe've finished creating all the functions we need to process the response from our backend. Let's add renderError \n renderFormData in the appropriate places in the original submitHandler. In addition, let's reset the form after we know it worked.\n\n\nvar submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  var path = apiURL + '/forms'\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) {\n      renderError(err)\n      throw err\n    }\n    console.log(data)\n    renderFormData(data)\n    document.querySelector('form').reset()\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you fill out the form, you should see a response similar to what was described in the \nSerialize the form data\n section in your console. For example:\n\n\n{\n  \nid\n: 1,\n  \nname\n: \nTesty McTesterson\n,\n  \nemail\n: \ntest@sandiegojs.org\n,\n  \ncity\n: \nSan Diego\n,\n  \nstate\n: \nCA\n,\n  \ngithub\n: \ntestdev\n,\n  \ntwitter\n: \ntesttwitter\n,\n  \nbio\n: \nLorem Ipsum...\n,\n  \nskills_attributes\n: [\n    {\n      \nid\n: 1,\n      \ndescription\n: \ncooking\n,\n      \nform_id\n: 1,\n      \ncreated_at\n: \n2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z\n,\n      \nupdated_at\n: \n2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z\n\n    },\n    {\n      \nid\n: 2,\n      \ndescription\n: \ncleaning\n,\n      \nform_id\n: 1,\n      \ncreated_at\n: \n2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z\n,\n      \nupdated_at\n: \n2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z\n\n    }\n  ],\n  \ncreated_at\n: \n2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z\n,\n  \nupdated_at\n: \n2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nOn screen you should see the this:\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!

            "text": "Now that we've covered the basics of getting a DOM element and hooking into it's events, let's add a submit event handler to the form. Later, we'll use this handler to kick off a request to the backend.  Our first step in this new file is to get a reference to the form element. Create a variable named  form , and assign the form DOM element on the page to it.  var form = document.querySelector('form')  On the next line create a  submitHandler  function. We will need to have the event passed into the handler available to us so add the parameter  evt  to the function declaration.  var submitHandler = function(evt) {}  We will be using the  preventDefault  method on the event object. This handy method will stop the form from submitting to the backend so that we can submit this information using AJAX.  Let's also throw in an  alert  so that we can see some feedback from the submit handler. Otherwise, when we click on the submit button nothing will happen which can be confusing. Add the two new commands to the submit handler declaration like below.  var submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  alert('submit!')\n}  In order to hook this handler up to our form element, we will need to use the  addEventListener  method that exists on the form node. Pass in the event we want to listen for  submit  as well as the custom handler we just wrote.  form.addEventListener('submit', submitHandler)  Now if you refresh the page you should be able to submit the form after filling out the two required fields, but instead of the page refreshing and losing everything you've entered the page will show you an alert and you won't lose any of the information you typed.  Our event handler is now working!",

            "location": "/ajax/#serialize-the-form-data", 
            "text": "Before we can begin to assemble the pieces for talking to our server, we will need to make sure that we can capture the data from our form in a format that our API endpoint can digest. The API for this workshop is built with  rails-api  which will be expecting a JSON API object on the request.  We need to take the form data and convert it to an object that looks like this  {\n   form : {\n     name :  ,\n     email :  ,\n     city :  ,\n     state :  ,\n     github :  ,\n     twitter :  ,\n     bio :  ,\n     skills_attributes : []\n  }\n}  If we were using something like jQuery we may use the  .serializeArray()  method. Let's write our own  serializeArray  method.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {}  We want to be able to pass in our selector for the form to this method and get the JSON object back. First, let's use  document.querySelector  again to grab the form.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n}  ProTip\u2122:   In our example, we know we are passing in a form selector but if you wanted to use this method in a different scenario, you might want to check that the element we have selected is actually a form by using  form.tagName  to check the element's tag name.  Now we need to grab all the inputs from inside the form element. Remember the  querySelectorAll  method mentioned above? While  querySelector  returns a single Node in the DOM,  querySelectorAll  will return a  NodeList .  The unusual thing about this is that  NodeList  is not a JavaScript  Array  and so we cannot use methods like  map  or  forEach  to iterate over the items returned. We could do some fancy work and add these methods to the prototype for  NodeList , but to keep things simple we will just use a basic  for  loop to iterate over them.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input,textarea')\n\n  for (var i = 0; i   formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n  }\n}  Now that we can iterate over them we will need to store the  name  and  value  of each item onto a JSON object as the  key , value  pair. When we are accessing the  Node  directly, we can easily call  node.name  or  node.value  to access these attributes.  We can't test our method unless we call our  serializeArray  method from somewhere, so let's add the call into our  submitHandler  method.  var submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  var data = serializeArray('form')\n}  Ok, now let's build our final  data  JSON object. Let's also log it to the console so that we can inspect it make sure it matches our expected output that we defined above.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input,textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i   formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n    data[item.name] = item.value\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}  When you reload the page and submit the form again, you should see something similar to this outputted in the console.   Well that looks  nearly  correct. Can you spot the problems?  Firstly, we're capturing the submit button. There are a couple ways to avoid this.  We could change the submit button from an  input  to a  div  and change our handler from the  form   submit  event to the  div   onclick  event. If we were to do this, we would lose the native validations, so let's nix this idea.  We could instead just change our  querySelectorAll(...)  selector string to ignore the  type=submit  input. That seems simple enough, so let's add that in.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input:not([type=submit]),textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i   formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n    data[item.name] = item.value\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}  Ok, let's try this again!   Something is still off. Did you spot it?  We need our  skills_attributes  key to have an array value since we have multiple skills. Right now, only the very last skill is being saved. We want to catch this special case inside of our  for  loop. If we haven't created this new  skills_attributes  array, do so and append the current skill, and if we have then just append the current skill.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input:not([type=submit]),textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i   formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n\n    if (item.name === 'skills_attributes') {\n      if (!!data[item.name]) {\n        data[item.name].push(item.value)\n      } else {\n        data[item.name] = [item.value]\n      }\n    } else {\n      data[item.name] = item.value\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}  Head back over to the console, and you'll see our data now looks correct! Our last step is to remove the  console.log  and replace it with a return statement that returns an object with a  form  property set to our data, since this is the structure our API endpoint is expecting.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input:not([type=submit]),textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i   formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n\n    if (item.name === 'skills_attributes') {\n      if (!!data[item.name]) {\n        data[item.name].push(item.value)\n      } else {\n        data[item.name] = [item.value]\n      }\n    } else {\n      data[item.name] = item.value\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n     form : data\n  }\n}",

            "text": "Now that we have our data we need to send it to the server using an XHR or  XMLHttpRequest . This allows us to communicate with the server without changing pages, and then do some action based on the data we get back. We are going to create a function that we can put in our event handlers that will do this.  var xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {}  First, we create a new instance of XHR.  var xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n}  Next we'll use  open(method, path, async)  to initialize the request.   method:  a string of an HTTP method to use, such as 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'. This will match the Verb on the API table up top.  path:  a string of the full path to send the request to. This will include the API endpoint URL as well as the path.  async:  a boolean flag that dictates whether the script should run asynchronously.   ProTip\u2122:   async  should always be  true  to prevent blocking. Stopping JavaScript execution especially hurts time sensitive things like rendering or event listening/handling.  var xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n}  Because we'll be using a JSON endpoint any requests we make to it should contain a  Content-Type  header.  var xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n}  XHR only has one event we care to listen to and that's  onreadystatechange .  The ready state of the XHR will change a few times, but we are looking for the last state of  4  which is triggered when the request operation is complete.  We'll also check to make sure we got a good server response. If it passes those checks, we'll parse the response JSON, then send the object back though a callback.  var xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n  request.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    // ignore anything that isn't the last state\n    if (request.readyState !== 4) { return }\n\n    // if we didn't get a  good  status such as 200 OK or 201 Created send back an error\n    if (request.readyState === 4   (request.status !== 200   request.status !== 201)) {\n      callback(new Error('XHR Failed: ' + path), null)\n    }\n\n    // return our server data\n    callback(null, JSON.parse(request.responseText))\n  }\n}  Lastly we will use  JSON.stringify  to convert our object to a JSON string and send the request with our data using the  send  function.  var xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n  request.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    // ignore anything that isn't the last state\n    if (request.readyState !== 4) { return }\n\n    // if we didn't get a  good  status such as 200 OK or 201 Created send back an error\n    if (request.readyState === 4   (request.status !== 200   request.status !== 201)) {\n      callback(new Error('XHR Failed: ' + path), null)\n    }\n\n    // return our server data\n    callback(null, JSON.parse(request.responseText))\n  }\n  request.send(JSON.stringify(data))\n}  Now we're ready to use it inside of our  submitHandler . We can call it with the 'POST' method and pass it the form data.  var apiURL = '//sandiegojs-vanilla-workshop.herokuapp.com'\n\nvar submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  var path = apiURL + '/forms'\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) { throw err }\n    console.log(data)\n  })\n}",

            "location": "/ajax/#handle-server-response", 
            "text": "Congratulations! We can now submit the form to the server and get a response. Now let's do something with the response.  We're going to write any errors from our XHR request to the screen. We're also going to render the contents of the form to the screen if it was successfully submitted.  Some of the methods we'll be using are:   Document.createElement  this method creates a DOM element of the type specified in the first parameter. For example, we can pass in  div ,  p ,  ul , etc.  Document.createTextNode  this method creates a text node that can be placed in the document. We'll use this to hold content we author.  Node.appendChild  this method can be called on any element created using createElement. As you can guess from the name it adds the node passed in to the end of node you call appendChild on.   Let's create a small helper function. It creates a DOM node and adds some text to it. We're going to be making a lot calls to this.  var createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {}  Right inside of that function declaration we should add a call to  document.createElement .  var createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n}  Next up we will create a text node that will hold whatever is inside of the tagContent variable.  var createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n}  Then we combine the two freshly created nodes. You can add other HTML nodes or text nodes to a node even if the HTML node would usually have children, such as  br .  var createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n  node.appendChild(textNode)\n}  There is a possibility that when we call this function we won't have any textContent, and calling  document.createTextNode  without textContent will cause an error. To avoid this kind of error wrap the creation and insertion of the textNode in a conditional test for textContent.  var createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n  if (tagContent) {\n    var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n    node.appendChild(textNode)\n  }\n}  And lastly we will return the node we created with a child text node.  var createElementWithTextNode = function(tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName)\n  if (tagContent) {\n    var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n    node.appendChild(textNode)\n  }\n  return node\n}  Now that we have that built, we can start to output some content. First create the renderError function  var renderError = function(error) {}  The error render will be very simple. We are going to get a reference to the response container, create a node with our helper function, add a custom class to it, and append it to the document.  var renderError = function(error) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n  var errorNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', error.toString())\n  errorNode.className = 'error'\n  responseNode.appendChild(errorNode)\n}  Now it's time to create the renderFormData function. This function is going to create many DOM nodes and append them to the response container.  var renderFormData = function(data) {}  The first thing we want to do inside of the renderFormData function is get a reference to the response container just like in our  renderError  function.  var renderFormData = function(data) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n}  Now, let's create a generic success message so we can see on screen when the form was submitted and the backend saved it.  var renderFormData = function(data) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n\n  //generic success message\n  var successNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', 'You\\'ve add a new card')\n  successNode.className = 'success'\n  responseNode.appendChild(successNode)\n}  Great, now we can give some kind of feedback to the user when the form is successfully processed by backend or not. Let's improve upon this, though. Let's show the information we entered when we submitted so we can verify it saved properly.  To do this we'll create a dictionary list, and fill it with all the some of the information that is returned by the request.  Let's use the  document.createElement  method to create a DL node that will hold all those terms and definitions. Append this to the  renderFormData  function.  var dictionaryNode = document.createElement('dl')  The next step is to add some terms and definitions. Let's use the  createElementWithTextNode  helper function to streamline the process of printing out the name. Add the next couple of lines after the  dictionaryNode  variable declaration and assignment.  //create a dom node with the name of a value\nvar termNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'name')\ndictionaryNode.appendChild(termNode)\n\n//create another dom node with the value\nvar definitionNode = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data.name)\ndictionaryNode.appendChild(definitionNode)  Now, after the success message we're printing out the name we entered on the form. This response would be more useful if we showed more information. It would be good to show the name, email, and some other attributes. The simplest way to do this is to just copy and paste the code we just wrote and swap out name for email, github, etc.  But, there's a better way. If we create a list of keys we'd like to show on screen, we can loop through them with the native  forEach  method of an array. This method will iterate over an array and call a passed in callback function for each item in the array. The first parameter of the callback will be the current item that forEach is iterating through.  Create an array called keys. Place it just after the insertion of the success message, but keep it before the last set of statements we wrote.  var keys = ['name', 'email', 'github', 'twitter', 'city', 'state', 'bio']  Next call the  forEach  method on it and pass in an  anonymous function  with a single parameter of  key .  keys.forEach(function(key) {})  Move the name definition and insertion we wrote earlier into the callback. Change the text passed into  createElementWithTextNode . For the first call replace the string literal,  'name'  with the variable  key , and for the second call replace  data.name  with  data[key] . This will allow each iteration to print the current key, such as name or email, as the dictionary term and the actual value, such as \"John Doe\", will be the dictionary definition.  keys.forEach(function(key) {\n  //create a dom node with the name of a value\n  var termNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', key)\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(termNode)\n\n  //create another dom node with the value\n  var definitionNode = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data[key])\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(definitionNode)\n})  If you review the array of keys we're looping through, you'll notice we didn't include  skills_attributes  like we did when we posted the data. That's because the content of that property is more complex than the simple strings of the other properties. If we want to print them out we'll have to write some custom logic.  Create a new dictionary term node like we do in the  forEach  callback, but set the text content to \"skills\".  var skillsTermNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'skills')\ndictionaryNode.appendChild(skillsTermNode)  Let's add the dictionary definition, now. We'll add the actual skills information in the next step. We'll show all the skills as a list, so let's also add a  UL  node as well and store a reference to it in a variable so we can add  LI  elements to it later.  var skillsDefinitionNode = document.createElement('dd')\nvar skillsList = document.createElement('ul')\nskillsDefinitionNode.appendChild(skillsList)\ndictionaryNode.appendChild(skillsDefinitionNode)  Now that that's out of the way, let's loop through each skill we received, if any, and combine them into one dictionary definition. To accomplish this we'll test to see if there is any value stored in  skills_attributes . If there is then we can loop through all the skills by using the  forEach  method to loop through each complex element in the array and append a simpler set of information to the dictionary. In our case, we'll append only the description of each skill wrapped in a  LI  tag.  if (data.skills_attributes) {\n  data.skills_attributes.forEach(function (skill) {\n    var skillNode = createElementWithTextNode('li', skill.description)\n    skillsList.appendChild(skillNode)\n  })\n}  The last steps are to add a custom class of  response  and append the dictionaryNode we've been populating to the responseNode from the beginning of the function. Here is the entire  renderFormData  function:  var renderFormData = function(data) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n\n  //generic success message\n  var successNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', 'You\\'ve add a new card')\n  successNode.className = 'success'\n  responseNode.appendChild(successNode)\n\n  var dictionaryNode = document.createElement('dl')\n  var keys = ['name', 'email', 'github', 'twitter', 'city', 'state', 'bio']\n  keys.forEach(function(key) {\n    //create a dom node with the name of a value\n    var termNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', key)\n    dictionaryNode.appendChild(termNode)\n\n    //create another dom node with the value\n    var definitionNode = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data[key])\n    dictionaryNode.appendChild(definitionNode)\n  })\n\n  var skillsTermNode = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'skills')\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(skillsTermNode)\n\n  var skillsDefinitionNode = document.createElement('dd')\n  var skillsList = document.createElement('ul')\n  skillsDefinitionNode.appendChild(skillsList)\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(skillsDefinitionNode)\n\n  if (data.skills_attributes) {\n    data.skills_attributes.forEach(function (skill) {\n      var skillNode = createElementWithTextNode('li', skill.description)\n      skillsList.appendChild(skillNode)\n    })\n  }\n\n  dictionaryNode.className = 'response'\n  responseNode.appendChild(dictionaryNode)\n}  We've finished creating all the functions we need to process the response from our backend. Let's add renderError   renderFormData in the appropriate places in the original submitHandler. In addition, let's reset the form after we know it worked.  var submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  var path = apiURL + '/forms'\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) {\n      renderError(err)\n      throw err\n    }\n    console.log(data)\n    renderFormData(data)\n    document.querySelector('form').reset()\n  })\n}  If you fill out the form, you should see a response similar to what was described in the  Serialize the form data  section in your console. For example:  {\n   id : 1,\n   name :  Testy McTesterson ,\n   email :  test@sandiegojs.org ,\n   city :  San Diego ,\n   state :  CA ,\n   github :  testdev ,\n   twitter :  testtwitter ,\n   bio :  Lorem Ipsum... ,\n   skills_attributes : [\n    {\n       id : 1,\n       description :  cooking ,\n       form_id : 1,\n       created_at :  2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z ,\n       updated_at :  2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z \n    },\n    {\n       id : 2,\n       description :  cleaning ,\n       form_id : 1,\n       created_at :  2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z ,\n       updated_at :  2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z \n    }\n  ],\n   created_at :  2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z ,\n   updated_at :  2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z \n}  On screen you should see the this:   Congratulations! Now we have a fully submitting form that we can use to save people's information.",

            "text": "Add JS Validation\n\n\nEarlier you added form validation using attributes. This is a quick and easy way to perform validation, but it does have limits. For example, you can't add custom error messages or styling. To get more flexibility and control, use JavaScript.\n\n\nIn this section, you will be playing with the HTML5 constraint validation API to check and customize the state of a form element. You have several goals:\n\n\n\n\nProvide a custom validation message when the Email the user types is invalid\n\n\nHide that custom validation message as soon as the email is valid\n\n\nAdd custom validation logic to the State field without using an attribute\n\n\nApply custom styling to the validation error messages\n\n\nPrevent form submission if there are validation errors.\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve these goals you will:\n\n\n\n\nAdd a keyup event listener to the email field to present a custom message\n\n\nAdd \nvalidateForm\n function to handle validation logic\n\n\nModify the form submit event listener to validate the form\n\n\nLoop through the form elements\n\n\nCheck the validity of each field\n\n\nSet or clear the validation error messages\n\n\nAdd custom validation logic to the state field\n\n\n\n\nHandle \nkeyup\n event for email field\n\n\n\n\nGet a reference to email field. Hint: Use a query selector you learned about earlier.\n\n\nAdd a \nkeyup\n event listener attached to the email field.\n\n\nInside the event listener function, you will check the \nemail.validity.typeMismatch\n property to determine if the email the user has typed is valid.\n\n\n\n\nif (email.validity.typeMismatch) {\n\n} else {\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf there is a problem \ntypeMatch\n will be \ntrue\n. This is your opportunity to set a custom error message using the \nsetCustomValidity\n function.\n\n\nif (email.validity.typeMismatch) {\n  email.setCustomValidity('Oops, try a real email address.');\n} else {\n  email.setCustomValidity('');\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you pass \n''\n to \nsetCustomValidity\n the field will be considered valid.\n\n\nThe complete event handler should look like this:\n\n\nvar email = document.querySelector('input[name=\nemail\n]');\n\n// Check for valid email while the user types\nemail.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {\n  // see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState for\n  // other validity states\n  if (email.validity.typeMismatch) {\n    email.setCustomValidity('Oops, try a real email address.');\n  } else {\n    email.setCustomValidity('');\n  }\n}, false);\n\n\n\n\nTry the new logic. Go to your form, add a name, but leave the email blank. Click Submit. Start typing your name in the Email field. Notice that now you see your custom message. Now type a valid email address. The message goes away as soon as the address is valid.\n\n\nAdd \nvalidateForm\n function to handle validation logic\n\n\nYou can use the technique above to handle each validated field, but you are still stuck with the standard formatting for the messages. To get more control, you need to turn off the automatic validation and handle the submission event yourself. \n\n\nAdd a line to prevent the automatic validation behavior.\n\n\nform.noValidate = true;\n\n\nProTip: You can achieve the same thing by adding a \nnovalidate\n attribute to the form.\n\n\nWith the automatic validation turned off, you have more control over when the validation check is done. \n\n\nAdd a new function, \nvalidateForm\n, to handle the validation check. This function, after you implement it fully, will determine any field errors and allow the form to determine if it valid. \n\n\nfunction validateForm(form){\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nModify the \nsubmit\n event listener\n\n\nBack in the \"Add submit event\" section, you added a \nsubmit\n event handler. You will modify that to call the validation logic. Inside the \nsubmitHandler\n function, you will call \nvalidateForm\n.\n\n\n\nfunction submitHandler(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault();\n\n  var form = evt.target;\n  validateForm(form);\n\n  // remaining submit handler logic goes here\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow you need to have the form check if it is valid before submitting data to the server. The \nform\n element has a convenient \ncheckValidity\n function to do just that. \n\n\n\nfunction submitHandler(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault();\n\n  var form = evt.target;\n  validateForm(form);\n\n  if (form.checkValidity()) { // if no error, go ahead and submit\n    // remaining submit handler logic goes here\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the next few steps, you will implement the validation logic for the fields.\n\n\nLoop through the fields\n\n\nEvery form has an elements array. You can use that to loop through the fields.\n\n\nIn the \nvalidateForm\n function, create the loop.\n\n\nfunction validateForm(form) {\n  var f;\n  for (f = 0; f \n form.elements.length; f++) {\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWithin the loop, get a reference to the current field. \nvalidateForm\n should now look like:\n\n\nfunction validateForm(form) {\n  var f;\n  var field;\n\n  for (f = 0; f \n form.elements.length; f++) {\n    field = form.elements[f];\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe behavior of the form hasn't changed so charge on to the next section.\n\n\nCheck the field validity\n\n\nUse a function to encapsulate all of the field validation logic. Start with using the standard validation logic.\n\n\nCreate a new function \nisValid\n that takes a field as a parameter.\n\n\nLike the form, fields have a \ncheckValidity\n method. Use this method to determine the return value for the function. Here's how it should look:\n\n\nfunction isValid(field) {\n  return field.checkValidity();\n}\n\n\n\n\nCall this function from the loop inside the \nvalidateForm\n function.\n\n\nfunction validateForm(form) {\n  var f;\n  var field;\n\n  for (f = 0; f \n form.elements.length; f++) {\n    field = form.elements[f];\n    if(isValid(field)) {\n      // remove error styles and messages\n    } else {\n      // style field, show error, etc.\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSet and clear error messages\n\n\nNow that you are looping through each field and checking its validity, you can use the information to format the feedback to the user. In the HTML, you may have noticed that below the fields that have validation, there is a \nspan\n element. You will use this element to display feedback to the user.\n\n\nCreate a \nsetError\n function that takes a field as a parameter.\n\n\nInside the function, get a reference to the \nspan\n you will use to show the error. To do that, use the handy \nnextElementSibling\n.\n\n\nUsing the reference to the element, set its \ninnerHTML\n to the field's \nvalidationMessage\n. The \nvalidationMessage\n is either the default message from the browser or a custom message you set. The finished function should loop like:\n\n\nfunction setError(field) {\n  var error = field.nextElementSibling;\n  if (error) error.innerHTML = field.validationMessage;\n}\n\n\n\n\nSet up a similar function to clear the error text. Copy and paste the \nsetError\n function.\n\n\nChange the function name to \nclearError\n.\n\n\nInstead of \nfield.validationMessage\n, set the \ninnerHTML\n to \n''\n. The complete function is:\n\n\nfunction clearError(field) {\n  var error = field.nextElementSibling;\n  if (error) error.innerHTML = '';\n}\n\n\n\n\nProTip: This is just one way of handling error messages. For example, you could use css to show and hide error messages or put all validation errors in a central location on the page. \n\n\nFinish the logic by calling these function from \nvalidateForm\n. If the field is valid, call \nclearError\n and if not call \nsetError\n.\n\n\nfunction validateForm(form) {\n  var f;\n  var field;\n\n  for (f = 0; f \n form.elements.length; f++) {\n    field = form.elements[f];\n    if(isValid(field)) {\n      // remove error styles and messages\n      clearError(field);\n    } else {\n      // style field, show error, etc.\n      setError(field);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTry it out. Click Submit. Do you see the error messages? Do the error messages disappear when you enter valid data?\n\n\nAs you type in the email field, does the message change? No? What is missing from the \nkeyup\n event listener?\n\n\nAdd custom validation logic to the state field\n\n\nTime for the bonus round! Custom validation logic could involve evaluating multiple fields on the form, making a call to the server, or performing some calculation in a worker thread. While those are beyond the time you have for this workshop, this section will walk you through creating a some custom logic. Keep in mind that there are better ways to enforce the logic presented in the here, but hey, use your imagination. ;-)\n\n\nYou will add this logic to the top of the \nisValid\n function you created earlier.\n\n\nFirst, check if the field passed to the function is named \nstate\n.\n\n\nIf so, check if the state is in the list of valid states. Valid states include: CA, TX, NY.\n\n\nfunction isValid(field) {\n  // custom logic for state\n  if (field.name === 'state') {\n    var validStates = ['CA', 'TX', 'NY'];\n    if (validStates.indexOf(field.value) === -1) {\n      // invalid state\n    } else {\n      // valid state\n    }\n  }\n  return field.checkValidity();\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen the state is invalid, set a custom validity message. When it is not, set an empty string.\n\n\n    ...\n    if (validStates.indexOf(field.value) === -1) {\n      // invalid state\n      field.setCustomValidity('Use CA, TX, or NY');\n    } else {\n      // valid state\n      field.setCustomValidity('');\n    }\n    ...\n\n\n\n\nNow when you try to submit without a state or an invalid state, you will get an error message just like with name and email.\n\n\nThat's it for validation! You may now add \"HTML5 constraint validation API\" to your resume.\n\n\nAdding classes to style error message or boxes\n\n\nWelcome text with cookies\n\n\nCookies are a classic way to provide a unique visitor experience based on previous visits.  In our case we would like to show a generic welcome message the first time a user visits our site, but show an alternative, and more personalized message when a user returns for any additional visits from the same device.  Note that cookies are stored on the user\u2019s device, so if they return from a new device or clear their cookies, we won\u2019t have a cookie and will not know they are a returning visitor.  Cookies are often associated with tracking of user visits, be sure to read up on that before implementing on your own.\n\n\nHere are the basics.   Cookies are stored as key value pairs as a strings.  The DOM API allows you to set cookies by assigning a value to document.cookie.

This is when the cookie will go bye bye.\n\n\nGetting a cookie involves more work because you have to parse the value of document.cookie (which remember is just a plain text string with ; separators).

Cookie security is handled for you:  Cookies are stored with a security feature tied to the domain that was used to store the cookie.  That means that your code running in the browser can only read the cookies that were set on the same domain.  Also note, cookies are stored as strings in plain text, so any savvy user can look at the cookies on their machine (delete, or modify them) as they see fit.",

For example, you can't add custom error messages or styling. To get more flexibility and control, use JavaScript.  In this section, you will be playing with the HTML5 constraint validation API to check and customize the state of a form element. You have several goals:   Provide a custom validation message when the Email the user types is invalid  Hide that custom validation message as soon as the email is valid  Add custom validation logic to the State field without using an attribute  Apply custom styling to the validation error messages  Prevent form submission if there are validation errors.   To achieve these goals you will:   Add a keyup event listener to the email field to present a custom message  Add  validateForm  function to handle validation logic  Modify the form submit event listener to validate the form  Loop through the form elements  Check the validity of each field  Set or clear the validation error messages  Add custom validation logic to the state field",

This is your opportunity to set a custom error message using the  setCustomValidity  function.  if (email.validity.typeMismatch) {\n  email.setCustomValidity('Oops, try a real email address.');\n} else {\n  email.setCustomValidity('');\n}  If you pass  ''  to  setCustomValidity  the field will be considered valid.

To get more control, you need to turn off the automatic validation and handle the submission event yourself.   Add a line to prevent the automatic validation behavior.  form.noValidate = true;  ProTip: You can achieve the same thing by adding a  novalidate  attribute to the form.  With the automatic validation turned off, you have more control over when the validation check is done.   Add a new function,  validateForm , to handle the validation check.

Create a  setError  function that takes a field as a parameter.  Inside the function, get a reference to the  span  you will use to show the error. To do that, use the handy  nextElementSibling .  Using the reference to the element, set its  innerHTML  to the field's  validationMessage . The  validationMessage  is either the default message from the browser or a custom message you set. The finished function should loop like:  function setError(field) {\n  var error = field.nextElementSibling;\n  if (error) error.innerHTML = field.validationMessage;\n}  Set up a similar function to clear the error text. Copy and paste the  setError  function.  Change the function name to  clearError .  Instead of  field.validationMessage , set the  innerHTML  to  '' . The complete function is:  function clearError(field) {\n  var error = field.nextElementSibling;\n  if (error) error.innerHTML = '';\n}  ProTip: This is just one way of handling error messages. For example, you could use css to show and hide error messages or put all validation errors in a central location on the page.   Finish the logic by calling these function from  validateForm . If the field is valid, call  clearError  and if not call  setError .  function validateForm(form) {\n  var f;\n  var field;\n\n  for (f = 0; f   form.elements.length; f++) {\n    field = form.elements[f];\n    if(isValid(field)) {\n      // remove error styles and messages\n      clearError(field);\n    } else {\n      // style field, show error, etc.\n      setError(field);\n    }\n  }\n}  Try it out.

Keep in mind that there are better ways to enforce the logic presented in the here, but hey, use your imagination. ;-)  You will add this logic to the top of the  isValid  function you created earlier.  First, check if the field passed to the function is named  state .  If so, check if the state is in the list of valid states. Valid states include: CA, TX, NY.  function isValid(field) {\n  // custom logic for state\n  if (field.name === 'state') {\n    var validStates = ['CA', 'TX', 'NY'];\n    if (validStates.indexOf(field.value) === -1) {\n      // invalid state\n    } else {\n      // valid state\n    }\n  }\n  return field.checkValidity();\n}  When the state is invalid, set a custom validity message.
