But using libraries can add a lot of unneeded bloat to your project. This workshop will help you dig a little deeper into JavaScript and how to use the available browser APIs without using the $.\n\n\nThis workshop will feature:\n\n\n\n\nDOM API\n\n\nBrowser Event API\n\n\nUsing Cookies\n\n\nXHR Requests\n\n\nDynamic HTML\n\n\nTesting with Mocha\n\n\n\n\nThe example\n\n\nFor this workshop, we are going to build out a business card creator. There is a simple html form inside of \npublic/index.html\n that we will build upon and add life to. We'll collect common profile information that one would normally share professionally, like contact info and skills, and then display it.\n\n\nKeep your resources handy\n\n\nWorkshops are fun and can be a fast way to learn while building something potentially reusable. There will come a time, however, when you'll want to reference the API and see if there are other methods or functionality that you didn't know existed.\n\n\nA really good open-source resource that also provides great offline functionality for you future digital nomads is \nDevDocs.io\n. You can select the different APIs you want to be immediately searchable and they cover everything from the browser, to node, to rails, to elixir, and even more you never even knew about!\n\n\nFor this workshop, it may be useful to reference the sections that will align with this workshop:\n\n\n\n\nDOM API\n\n\nBrowser Event API\n\n\nUsing Cookies\n\n\nXHR Requests\n\n\nTesting with Mocha\n\n\n\n\nAnother good resource for learning about the available APIs and even the internals of how a browser parses, executes, and draws a page, is \nMozilla Developer Network\n.\n\n\nHave any other great resources you've used? We would love to hear about them and share them with the other attendees!\n\n\nPre-event Setup Instructions\n\n\nPrior to your arrival the following should be installed on your system:\n\n\n\n\nInstall Git\n\n\nInstall Node.js 4.2 LTS\n\n\nSetup NPM for non-sudo installation\n\n\nNPM is the node package manager.  It will automatically be installed when you install node.\n\n\nNPM installs packages \nlocally\n (within the directory it is invoked in) for per-project modules, or \nglobally\n for packages you want accessible everywhere.\n\n\nHowever, by default NPM installs global packages in a root-restricted location, requiring SUDO to install.  This creates a \nhuge\n headache.  As an alternative, \nbefore\n you install any packages, follow \nthis guide\n to configure your NPM to install in your home directory without requiring sudo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone this repository \ngit clone git@github.com:sandiegojs/vanilla-browser-workshop.git\n\n\nChange directories into the workshop folder: \ncd vanilla-browser-workshop\n and install your local dependencies with: \nnpm install\n\n\nInstall these global dependencies using the \n-g\n flag (ex \nnpm install \npackage\n -g\n)\n\n\ngulp\n\n\nmocha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you plan to deploy your app onto Heroku, setup \nHeroku Toolbelt\n\n\n\n\nAPI service\n\n\nThe app we will be building is a client-side application, meaning it will be running in a user's browser. We will need to persist the data that we are\ncreating to a backend service and database so that we can recall it later.\n\n\nWe could use fixture data or a mock service for this, but some friendly backend\ndevelopers have already made a working API for us, so let's use that.\n\n\nOur API is setup at \n//sandiegojs-vanilla-workshop.herokuapp.com\n and supports the following endpoints\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nVerb\npath\nDescription\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nGET\n/forms\nList of forms\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nPOST\n/forms\nCreate a new form\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nGET\n/forms/:id\nRetrieve a form\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nPUT\n/forms/:id\nUpdate a form\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nDELETE\n/forms/:id\nDelete a form\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nGET\n/skills\nList of skills\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nPOST\n/skills\nCreate a new skill\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nGET\n/skills/:id\nRetrieve a skill\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nPUT\n/skills/:id\nUpdate a skill\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nDELETE\n/skills/:id\nDelete a skill\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nThis project uses the build tool \nGulp\n to automate a bunch of stuff for you. The gulp tasks are all defined in the \ntasks\n directory if you're the curious type. They are used to compile the sources and styles found within the \napp\n directory and put the final compiled source and styles into the \npublic\n directory. The \npublic/index.html\n will include the final styles and scripts inside of it.\n\n\nIn order to get started, this boilerplate has been setup to show us a simple form right from the start. So let's dive in and give the gulp step a try!\n\n\nType the following from the root of the project:\n\n\n$ gulp\n\n\nYou should see some output similar to the following:\n\n\n$ gulp\n[16:02:13] Requiring external module babel-core/register\n[16:02:14] Using gulpfile ~/Code/vanilla-browser-workshop/gulpfile.babel.js\n[16:02:14] Starting 'scripts'...\n[16:02:14] Starting 'styles'...\n[16:02:14] Starting 'serve'...\n[16:02:14] Finished 'serve' after 46 ms\nlivereload[tiny-lr] listening on 35729 ...\n[16:02:15] Finished 'styles' after 175 ms\n[16:02:15] Finished 'scripts' after 355 ms\n[16:02:15] Starting 'default'...\n[16:02:15] Finished 'default' after 114 \u03bcs\nfolder \npublic\n serving at http://localhost:3000\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the scripts and styles are compiled, and then the server get's started. Now that we have that running, let's jump over to the browser and visit \nlocalhost:300\n.\n\n\n\n\nCool! We have a very simple form with some basic styling already good to go for us.\n\n\nIf you're having issues bug one of the instructors! We're here to help you out.\n\n\nThe HTML\n\n\nWe should know what kind of document we are working with before we move forward. Since the boilerplate was setup for us, we'll just need to open up the \npublic/index.html\n file and take a look.\n\n\nYou should see that the styles are included in the header from \npublic/index.css\n and the script for our JavaScript is included at the top of the body from \npublic/index.js\n.\n\n\nProTip\u2122:\n When the browser encounters a \nscript\n tag, it is blocking - meaning the browser will immediately download and execute it. To load the \nscript\n asynchronously and not block the browser's parsing of the document, set \nasync='true'\n on the tag.\n\n\nWithin the \npublic/index.html\n you should see a basic form with labels and inputs. Familiarize yourself with the different fields.\n\n\nAre you ready to get coding, yet?\n\n\nHTML field validation\n\n\nHave you ever used a form where you didn't realize you missed a required field until after clicking the submit button, waiting for the page to send data off to the server, waiting for the page to reload, and then finally to get the perplexing red error message at the top? What a pain!\n\n\nLet's save our users the hassle and let them know right away that they are required to fill in certain fields \nbefore\n sending anything off to the server.\n\n\nThere are a few different ways to do this, and we will elaborate on this later, but the most basic way to get going with form validation is using the built-in HTML field validations.\n\n\nRequired fields\n\n\nWe really only need the \nname\n and \nemail\n field to be required. In order to make these inputs required, all we have to do is add the word \nrequired\n as an attribute on the \ninput\n tag.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\ninput type='text' placeholder='Name' required\n\n\nGo ahead and update the \nname\n and \nemail\n inputs to include this special attribute.\n\n\nAfter making any changes to this project, be sure to save the file and reload your browser!\n\n\nLet's head over to \nlocalhost:3000\n again and try it out.\n\n\nIf you hit the submit button now, you should immediately see a pop-up message near the first missing input telling you the field is required like below.\n\n\n\n\nNeato! This is all taken care of for you by the browser out-of-the-box!\n\n\nNative validations\n\n\nSome \ninput\n types have intrinsic constraints, such as \ntype='email'\n. If you look at the \npublic/index.html\n you will see that our email field is currently setup as a \ntype='text'\n. Go ahead and change it.\n\n\nOnce you have, we can test it out. Head over to the browser, type in a \nName\n value (so that we don't get the required error) and type in a phoney string that doesn't look like an email address. Once you hit submit, you should see a nice message come up and tell you that your input doesn't look like an email.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about validations that are available for inputs, \nMDN has a great article covering the details\n.\n\n\nThe DOM\n\n\nThe Document Object Model(DOM) is how we are able to interact with our page via JavaScript. The DOM is a representation of what is on the page, including the elements and styles.\n\n\n\n\nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents. It provides a structured representation of the document (a tree) and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once that event is triggered the event handlers get executed. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages. -\nMDN\n\n\n\n\nOne of the trickest things about the DOM is that it's up to the browser vendor to implement it and therefore every implementation is a little different. This is why we get browser compatability issues.\n\n\nBut as you will see there is a large API exposed by the DOM which allows us to craft powerful user experiences. An easy way to think of the DOM is a tree of nested nodes and each node is an element from our HTML document, e.g. a \ndiv\n, \np\n, \nbutton\n, etc...\n\n\nTo visualize this all you need to do is open your web inspector and look at the \nElements\n tab to see this structure realized. Each one of those nodes (elements) has many properties and functions you can take advantage off.\n\n\n\n\nDOM selection\n\n\nIn order to interact with the DOM within JavaScript, the first thing you will need to understand is element selection. If you're familiar with a library such as \njQuery\n or \nZepto\n than you'll be used to doing this by way of the \n$()\n selector. By selecting an element (DOM node) we get a reference to that element which allows us to take actions on it.\n\n\nThere are several functions we can use to get a reference to a DOM node. Overtime these functions have been introduced to solve different needs. As such, the browser support for them can vary. You should always research browser compatability to ensure they will work for your user base.\n\n\n\n\nquerySelector\n\n\nquerySelectorAll\n\n\ngetElementById\n\n\ngetElementsByClassName\n\n\ngetElementsByName\n\n\ngetElementsByTagName\n\n\n\n\nFor now, we are going to focus on \nquerySelector\n. This function behaves similar to jQuery in that it allows you to specify a \ncss selector\n that will be used to find the first matching node. One of the nice feature of this function is that it is available both on the \ndocument\n as well as \nelement\n. This means you can search for an element in the entire document or narrow your search to the sub elements of an existing element.\n\n\nFor now, let's just open up the dev console and mess around. We can begin by selecting the input with a name attribute of \nname\n.\n\n\nvar inputName = document.querySelector('input[name=\nname\n]')\n\n\n\n\nThis returns us an \nHTMLInputElement\n which has a \nvalue\n property available. Go ahead and set the value property to see an example of how you can change the DOM.\n\n\ninputName.value = 'My new value!'\n\n\n\n\nYou should see the value you set reflected in the form's input.\n\n\nWhenever dealing with a DOM node it's important to understand what type of element you have and what are it's parents. That will determine the properties and functions available to you.\n\n\nEvent handling\n\n\nWhen users interact with the web page the DOM publishes these interactions as events, for example; \nclick\n, \nscroll\n, \nkeypress\n, and \nmore\n.\n\n\nAfter selecting an element from the DOM, we can call it's \naddEventListener\n method which will execute a callback function we provide any time that event occurs. Lets start by listening for a \nclick\n on the \ndocument\n and trigger an \nalert\n whenever that event occurs.\n\n\nvar handler = function() {\n  alert('user clicked on the page')\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', handler)\n\n\n\n\nNow if you click on the page you should receive an alert with your message. Alerting users every time they click the page can get annoying so lets remove that event listener.\n\n\ndocument.removeEventListener('click', handler)\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to note that in order for us to be able to remove an event listener we need to name our functions so we can specify what to remove for that event.\n\n\nUsing this simple API we can trigger the complex logic we will be writing shortly.\n\n\nMultiple event listeners\n\n\nOne of the great things about event listeners is that we can attach multiple listeners per event. For example:\n\n\nvar handlerOne = function() {\n  // Do some logic\n}\n\nvar handlerTwo = function() {\n  // Do some logic\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', handlerOne)\ndocument.addEventListener('click', handlerTwo)\n\n\n\n\nNow both of these functions will be executed whenever someone clicks the page.\n\n\nEvent listener parameter\n\n\nWhen we attach callback functions to events these functions are passed as an event argument. The type of event given will change depending on the type input device which triggered it. Since we are listening for a \nclick\n event we will receive a \nMouseEvent\n.\n\n\nvar logEvent = function(evt) {\n  console.log(evt)\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', logEvent)\n\n\n\n\nIf you inspect this event in the console you will see there are quite a few properties available to us. The ones most commonly used are \ntarget\n and \ncurrentTarget\n.\n\n\ntarget\n is the element who dispatched the event.\n\n\ncurrentTarget\n is the element who handled the event during the event capture (a.k.a bubbling) phase.\n\n\nAlthough important, we won't dive into the distinction between these two just yet. For our purposes we are going to use the \ncurrentTarget\n event to always get a reference to the element who has the event listener listening for the event.\n\n\nAdd and remove skills\n\n\nNow that we know how to add event listeners, let's add some additional functionality to our form. We have more than just a single skill to boast about, so we want to be able to add multiple skills. We may also change our mind while we're filling out the form so we will have to be able to remove a skill, also.\n\n\nAdding a skill\n\n\nYou probably noticed the nice \n+\n button next to the \nskills\n input. Right now it doesn't do anything. We need to add a \nclick\n handler in order to bring it to life.\n\n\nIn order to do that, we need to first select the \n.add-skill\n button which we will attach the handler to and then we need to also have a \"blueprint\" of the original div containing the skill elements so that we can copy it when we add another one.\n\n\nvar addSkillButton = document.querySelector('.add-skill')\nvar skillTemplate = document.querySelector('.skills')\n\nvar addSkillHandler = function(evt) {\n  alert('adding skill')\n}\naddSkillButton.addEventListener('click', addSkillHandler)\n\n\n\n\nIf you give this a try in your browser now, you'll see the alert pop up when you click on the plus.\n\n\nWhat does \"add skill\" really mean? We want to duplicate the skill blueprint we have, \nskillTemplate\n and create another Node just like it. Then, we want to append it at the end of the list of skills.\n\n\nWe can clone any DOM Node with the \ncloneNode\n method. The \ncloneNode\n method takes an optional boolean argument to determine whether it should be a deep or shallow clone. Since we want the entire \ninput-group\n element and all of it's children Nodes, we are going to pass a \ntrue\n in.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no \nappendAfter\n method we can use like in jQuery, but there is an \ninsertBefore\n method. We can use \ninsertBefore\n to append the new cloned Node just before the submit button.\n\n\nThe \ninsertBefore\n method uses a handle on the parent node to attach the new Node in the correct spot within the tree. We can use the \nparentNode\n accesor on any DOM Node to get it's parent, or, since we know the parent is the form we can just directly select it again.\n\n\nvar addSkillButton = document.querySelector('.add-skill')\nvar skillTemplate = document.querySelector('.skills').cloneNode(true)\n\nvar addSkillHandler = function(evt) {\n  var submitNode = document.querySelector('.submit')\n  var parentNode = submitNode.parentNode\n  var newSkill = skillTemplate.cloneNode(true)\n  parentNode.insertBefore(newSkill, submitNode)\n}\naddSkillButton.addEventListener('click', addSkillHandler)\n\n\n\n\nWe just grew a branch on our DOM tree \ud83c\udf33! Does it look right, though?\n\n\n\n\nAfter we clone a new node, we need to change the plus sign to a minus sign on the previous one. If you look at the \npublic/index.html\n you'll see that both the plus and minus icons already exist in the DOM, except that the minus is currently \nhidden\n with the class \nhidden\n.\n\n\nIn jQuery, you can use the \n.last()\n method after selecting a group of elements to get the last one. Let's write a helper method that does just that for a given selector.\n\n\nvar last = function(selector) {\n  var all = document.querySelectorAll(selector)\n  var length = all.length\n  return all[length - 1]\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow let's update our \naddSkillHandler\n method to get a handle on the previous skill, update it to show the minus instead of the plus, and \nthen\n add the new skill to the end of the list.\n\n\nWhen we have a handle on the DOM Node as we will with the previous skill, we can get a list of the Node's classes by using the \nclassList\n accessor\n. We can then use \n.add()\n and \n.remove()\n to add and remove classes from this Node.\n\n\nvar addSkillButton = document.querySelector('.add-skill')\nvar skillTemplate = document.querySelector('.skills')\n\nvar addSkillHandler = function(evt) {\n  var prevSkill = last('.skill')\n  var newSkill = skillTemplate.cloneNode(true)\n  var submitNode = document.querySelector('.submit')\n  var parentNode = submitNode.parentNode\n\n  prevSkill.querySelector('.add-skill').classList.add('hidden')\n  prevSkill.querySelector('.remove-skill').classList.remove('hidden')\n  parentNode.insertBefore(newSkill, submitNode)\n}\naddSkillButton.addEventListener('click', addSkillHandler)\n\n\n\n\nIf you head over to the browser, it should work! Sweet DOM manipulation.\n\n\nDid you try to click the second plus button like a smarty pants? Then you realize that it didn't work, right?\n\n\nFix it by attaching the handler to the new element as well.\n\n\nvar addSkillButton = document.querySelector('.add-skill')\nvar skillTemplate = document.querySelector('.skills')\n\nvar addSkillHandler = function(evt) {\n  var prevSkill = last('.skill')\n  var newSkill = skillTemplate.cloneNode(true)\n  var submitNode = document.querySelector('.submit')\n  var parentNode = submitNode.parentNode\n\n  prevSkill.querySelector('.add-skill').classList.add('hidden')\n  prevSkill.querySelector('.remove-skill').classList.remove('hidden')\n  newAddSkill.querySelector('.add-skill').addEventListener('click', addSkillHandler)\n\n  parentNode.insertBefore(newSkill, submitNode)\n}\naddSkillButton.addEventListener('click', addSkillHandler)\n\n\n\n\nGreat, now you're ready to remove some skills!\n\n\nRemoving a skill\n\n\nMuch like we created an event handler for adding a skill, we will now just create one to remove a skill.\n\n\nvar removeSkillHandler = function(evt) {}\n\n\n\n\nWhen the minus button is clicked, you'll remember from the event section that the minus button element becomes the \ncurrentTarget\n on the event object passed in as the first argument to our handler.\n\n\nIf we have a handle on the minus button, then we can select the \nparentNode\n to get the group of elements that makes up a single skill. And if we can do that, then we can just call \nremove()\n do remove the Node from the DOM.\n\n\nvar removeSkillHandler = function(evt) {\n  var skill = evt.currentTarget.parentNode\n  skill.remove()\n}\n\n\n\n\nAdd submit event\n\n\nNow that we've covered the basics of getting a DOM element and hooking into it's events, let's add a submit event handler to the form. Later, we'll use this handler to kick off a request to the backend.\n\n\nTo start create a new file called \nmain.js\n in the app directory.\n\n\nOur first step in this new file is to get a reference to the form element. Create a variable named \nform\n, and assign the form DOM element on the page to it.\n\n\nvar form = document.querySelector('form')\n\n\n\n\nOn the next line create a \nsubmitHandler\n function. We will need to have the event passed into the handler available to us so add the parameter \nevt\n to the function declaration.\n\n\nvar submitHandler = function(evt) {}\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using the \npreventDefault\n method on the event object. This handy method will stop the form from submitting to the backend so that we can submit this information using AJAX.\n\n\nLet's also throw in an \nalert\n so that we can see some feedback from the submit handler. Otherwise, when we click on the submit button nothing will happen which can be confusing. Add the two new commands to the submit handler declaration like below.\n\n\nvar submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  alert('submit!')\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn order to hook this handler up to our form element, we will need to use the \naddEventListener\n method that exists on the form node. Pass in the event we want to listen for (submit) as well as the custom handler we just wrote.\n\n\nform.addEventListener('submit', submitHandler)\n\n\n\n\nNow if you refresh the page you should be able to submit the form after filling out the two required fields, but instead of the page refreshing and losing everything you've entered the page will show you an alert and you won't lose any of the information you typed.\n\n\nOur event handler is now working!\n\n\nSerialize the form data\n\n\nBefore we can begin to assemble the pieces for talking to our server, we will need to make sure that we can capture the data from our form in a format that our API endpoint can digest. The API for this workshop is built with \nrails-api\n which will be expecting a JSON API object on the request.\n\n\nWe need to take the form data and convert it to an object that looks like this\n\n\n{\n  \nform\n: {\n    \nname\n: \n,\n    \nemail\n: \n,\n    \ncity\n: \n,\n    \nstate\n: \n,\n    \ngithub\n: \n,\n    \ntwitter\n: \n,\n    \nbio\n: \n,\n    \nskills_attributes\n: []\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf we were using something like jQuery we may use the \n.serializeArray()\n method. Let's write our own \nserializeArray\n method.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {}\n\n\n\n\nWe want to be able to pass in our selector for the form to this method and get the JSON object back. First, let's use \ndocument.querySelector\n again to grab the form.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n}\n\n\n\n\nProTip\u2122:\n  In our example, we know we are passing in a form selector but if you wanted to use this method in a different scenario, you might want to check that the element we have selected is actually a form by using \nform.tagName\n to check the element's tag name.\n\n\nNow we need to grab all the inputs from inside the form element. Remember the \nquerySelectorAll\n method mentioned above? While \nquerySelector\n returns a single Node in the DOM, \nquerySelectorAll\n will return a \nNodeList\n.\n\n\nThe unusual thing about this is that \nNodeList\n is not a JavaScript \nArray\n and so we cannot use methods like \nmap\n or \nforEach\n to iterate over the items returned. We could do some fancy work and add these methods to the prototype for \nNodeList\n, but to keep things simple we will just use a basic \nfor\n loop to iterate over them.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input,textarea')\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \n formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow that we can iterate over them we will need to store the \nname\n and \nvalue\n of each item onto a JSON object as the \nkey\n,\nvalue\n pair. When we are accessing the \nNode\n directly, we can easily call \nnode.name\n or \nnode.value\n to access these attributes.\n\n\nWe can't test our method unless we call our \nserializeArray\n method from somewhere, so let's add the call into our \nsubmitHandler\n method.\n\n\nvar submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  var data = serializeArray('form')\n}\n\n\n\n\nOk, now let's build our final \ndata\n JSON object. Let's also log it to the console so that we can inspect it make sure it matches our expected output that we defined above.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input,textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \n formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n    data[item.name] = item.value\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reload the page and submit the form again, you should see something similar to this outputted in the console.\n\n\n\n\nWell that looks \nnearly\n correct. Can you spot the problems?\n\n\nFirstly, we're capturing the submit button. There are a couple ways to avoid this.\n\n\nWe could change the submit button from an \ninput\n to a \ndiv\n and change our handler from the \nform\n \nsubmit\n event to the \ndiv\n \nonclick\n event. If we were to do this, we would lose the native validations, so let's nix this idea.\n\n\nWe could instead just change our \nquerySelectorAll(...)\n selector string to ignore the \ntype=submit\n input. That seems simple enough, so let's add that in.\n\n\nvar serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input:not([type=submit]),textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \n formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n    data[item.name] = item.value\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}\n\n\n\n\nOk, let's try this again!\n\n\n\n\nSomething is still off. Did you spot it?\n\n\nWe need our \nskills_attributes\n key to have an array value.\n\n\nBuild XHR and submit\n\n\nNow that we have our data we need to send it to the server using an XHR or \nXMLHttpRequest\n. This allows us to communicate with the server without changing pages then do some action based on the data we get back. We are going to create a function that we can put in our event handlers that will do this.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {}\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we create a new instance of XHR.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext we'll use \nopen(method, path, async)\n to initialize the request.\n\n\n\n\nmethod\n a string of an HTTP method to use, such as 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'. This will match the Verb on the API table up top.\n\n\npath\n a string of the full path to send the request to. This will include the API endpoint URL as well as the path.\n\n\nasync\n a boolean flag that dictates whether the script should run asynchronously.\n\n\n\n\nProTip\u2122:\n \nasync\n should always be \ntrue\n to prevent blocking. Stopping JavaScript execution especially hurts time sensitive things like rendering or event listening/handling.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n}\n\n\n\n\nBecause we'll be using a JSON endpoint any requests we make to it should contain a \nContent-Type\n header.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n}\n\n\n\n\nXHR only has one event we care to listen to and that's \nonreadystatechange\n.\n\n\nThe ready state of the XHR will change a few times, but we are looking for the last state of \n4\n which is triggered when the request operation is complete.\n\n\nWe'll also check to make sure we got a good server response. If it passes those checks, we'll parse the response JSON, then send the object back though a callback.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n  request.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    // ignore anything that isn't the last state\n    if (request.readyState !== 4) { return }\n\n    // if we didn't get a \ngood\n status such as 200 OK or 201 Created send back an error\n    if (request.readyState === 4 \n (request.status !== 200 \n request.status !== 201)) {\n      callback(new Error('XHR Failed: ' + path), null)\n    }\n\n    // return our server data\n    callback(null, JSON.parse(request.responseText))\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLastly just close and send the request with our data using the \nsend\n function.\n\n\nvar xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n  request.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    // ignore anything that isn't the last state\n    if (request.readyState !== 4) { return }\n\n    // if we didn't get a \ngood\n status such as 200 OK or 201 Created send back an error\n    if (request.readyState === 4 \n (request.status !== 200 \n request.status !== 201)) {\n      callback(new Error('XHR Failed: ' + path), null)\n    }\n\n    // return our server data\n    callback(null, JSON.parse(request.responseText))\n  }\n  request.send(data)\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow we're ready to use it inside of our \nsubmitHandler\n. We can call it with the 'POST' method and pass it the form data.\n\n\nvar apiURL = '//sandiegojs-vanilla-workshop.herokuapp.com'\n\nvar submitHandler = function (evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault();\n  var path = apiURL + '/forms'\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) { throw err }\n    console.log(data)\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\nHandle server response\n\n\nNow that we are able to submit the form to the server let's do something with the response. We're going to write any errors from our XHR request to the screen. We're also going to render the contents of the form to the screen if it was successfully submitted.\n\n\nSome of the methods we'll be using are:\n\n\n\n\nDocument.createElement\n this method creates a DOM element of the type specified in the first parameter. For example, we can pass in \ndiv\n, \np\n, \nul\n, etc.\n\n\nDocument.createTextNode\n this method creates a text node that can be placed in the document. We'll use this to hold content we author.\n\n\nNode.appendChild\n this method can be called on any element created using createElement. As you can guess from the name it adds the node passed in to the end of node you call appendChild on.\n\n\n\n\nLet's create a small helper function. It creates a DOM node and adds some text to it. We're going to be making a lot calls to this.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {}\n\n\n\n\nRight inside of that function declaration we should add a call to \ndocument.createElement\n. \n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName);\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext up we will create a text node that will hold whatever is inside of the tagContent variable.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName);\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen we combine the two freshly created nodes. You can add other HTML nodes or text nodes to a node even if the HTML node would usually have children, such as \nbr\n.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName);\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n  node.appendChild(textNode)\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly we will return the node we created with a child text node.\n\n\nvar createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName);\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n  node.appendChild(textNode)\n  return node\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have that built, we can start to output some content. First create the renderError function\n\n\nvar renderError = function (error) {}\n\n\n\n\nThe error render will be very simple. We are going to get a reference to the response container, create a node with our helper function, add a custom class to it, and append it to the document.\n\n\nvar renderError = function (error) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n  var errorNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', error.toString())\n  errorNode.className = 'error'\n  responseNode.appendChild(errorNode)\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow it's time to create the renderFormData function. This function is going to create many DOM nodes and append them to the response container.\n\n\nvar renderFormData = function(data) {}\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing we want to do inside of the renderFormData function is get a reference to the response container just like in our \nrenderError\n function\n\n\nUNFINISHED\n\n\nvar renderFormData = function (data) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n\n  //generic success message\n  var successNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', 'You\\'ve add a new card')\n  successNode.className = 'success'\n  responseNode.appendChild(successNode)\n\n  var dictionaryNode = document.createElement('dl')\n  var keys = ['name', 'email', 'github', 'twitter'], node;\n  keys.forEach(function (key) {\n    //create a dom node with the name of a value\n    node = createElementWithTextNode('dt', key)\n    dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n    //create another dom node with the value\n    node = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data[key])\n    dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n  })\n\n  //create a dom node with the name of a value\n  node = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'location')\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n  //create another dom node with the value\n  node = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data['city'] + ', ' + data['state'])\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n  //create a dom node with the name of a value\n  node = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'bio')\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n  //create another dom node with the value\n  node = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data['bio'])\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n  dictionaryNode.className = 'response'\n  responseNode.appendChild(dictionaryNode)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we just call renderError \n renderFormData in the appropriate places in the original submitHandler.\n\n\nvar submitHandler = function (evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault();\n  var path = apiURL + '/forms'\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) {\n      renderError(err)\n      throw err\n    }\n    console.log(data)\n    renderFormData(data)\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you fill out the form, you should see a response similar to what was described in the \nSerialize the form data\n section. For example:\n\n\n{\n  \nid\n: 1,\n  \nname\n: \nTesty McTesterson\n,\n  \nemail\n: \ntest@sandiegojs.org\n,\n  \ncity\n: \nSan Diego\n,\n  \nstate\n: \nCA\n,\n  \ngithub\n: \ntestdev\n,\n  \ntwitter\n: \ntesttwitter\n,\n  \nbio\n: \nLorem Ipsum...\n,\n  \ncreated_at\n: \n2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z\n,\n  \nupdated_at\n: \n2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, something will go wrong with a request and instead of receiving a new record from the backend we'll get an error of some kind! We already built our xhr function to let us know when something goes wrong during the AJAX request, but now we need to do something to let the user know that there was a problem.\n\n\nUpdate the xhr callback inside of the submitHandler function to show the user a generic error message in an alert when the callback receives an error.\n\n\n  ...\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) {\n      alert('Oh no! We\\'re sorry, but something went wrong! \\nCheck the console for more details.')\n      throw err\n    }\n    console.log(data)\n  })\n  ...\n\n\n\n\nRender the response\n\n\nAdd JS Validation\n\n\nEarlier you added form validation using attributes. This is a quick and easy way to perform validation, but it does have limits. For example, you can't add custom error messages or styling. To get more flexibility and control, use JavaScript.\n\n\nIn this section, you will be playing with the HTML5 constraint validation API to check and customize the state of a form element. You have several goals:\n\n\n\n\nProvide a custom validation message when the Email the user types is invalid\n\n\nHide that custom validation message as soon as the email is valid\n\n\nAdd custom validation logic to the State field without using an attribute\n\n\nApply custom styling to the validation error messages\n\n\nPrevent form submission if there are validation errors.\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve these goals you will:\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new file to handle validation logic.\n\n\nAdd a keyup event listener to the email field to present a custom message\n\n\nAdd a submit event listener to the form\n\n\nPrevent form submission if there are any errors\n\n\nLoop through the form elements\n\n\nCheck the validity of each field\n\n\nSet or clear the validation error messages\n\n\nAdd custom validation logic to the state field\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new file to handle validation logic\n\n\n\n\nIn the \napp\n directory, create \nvalidation.js\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis file will automatically be concatenated with any other js files during the build process.\n\n\nHandle \nkeyup\n event for email field\n\n\n\n\nGet a reference to email field. Hint: Use a query selector you learned about earlier.\n\n\nAdd \nkeyup\n event listener attached to the email field.\n\n\nInside the event listener function, you will check the \nemail.validity.typeMismatch\n property to determine if the email the user has typed is valid.\n\n\n\n\nif (email.validity.typeMismatch) {\n\n} else {\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is a problem \ntypeMatch\n will be \ntrue\n. This is your opportunity to set a custom error message using the \nsetCustomValidity\n function.\n\n\n\n\nif (email.validity.typeMismatch) {\n  email.setCustomValidity('Oops, can't send email to that.');\n} else {\n  email.setCustomValidity('');\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you pass \n''\n to \nsetCustomValidity\n the field will be considered valid.\n\n\nThe complete event handler should look like this:\n\n\nvar email = document.querySelector('input[name=\nemail\n]');\n\n// Check for valid email while the user types\nemail.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {\n  // see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState for\n  // other validity states\n  if (email.validity.typeMismatch) {\n    email.setCustomValidity('Oops, try a real email address.');\n  } else {\n    email.setCustomValidity('');\n  }\n  setError(email);\n}, false);\n\n\n\n\nTry the new logic. Go to your form, add a name, but leave the email blank. Click Submit. Start typing your name in the Email field. Notice that now you see your custom message. Now type a valid email address. The message goes away as soon as the address is valid.\n\n\nHandle \nsubmit\n event for form\n\n\nYou can use the technique above to handle each validated field, but you are still stuck with the standard formatting for the messages. To get more control, you need to turn off the automatic validation and handle the submission event yourself.\n\n\n\n\nGet a reference to the form element. Hint: Use the tag name.\n\n\nPrevent the automatic validation behavior.\n\n\n\n\nform.noValidate = true;\n\n\nPro Tip: You can achieve the same thing by adding a \nnovalidate\n attribute to the form.\n\n\n\n\nNow add a \nsubmit\n event handler that calls a \nvalidateForm\n function.\n\n\n\n\nYou should have the following:\n\n\nvar form = document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0];\n\n...\n\nform.noValidate = true;\n\nform.addEventListener('submit', validationForm, false);\n\nfunction validateForm(event) {\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nPrevent submission if there are any errors\n\n\nNow that you turned off the automatic validation, the form will always submit! You certainly don't want that.\n\n\n\n\nIf you didn't already create the \nvalidateForm\n function.\n\n\nInside the function, get a reference to the form using the \nevent.target\n.\n\n\nHave the form check if it is valid.\n\n\n\n\nvar form = event.target;\nif (!form.checkValidity()) {\n  // form is invalid\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow prevent the submission if there is a problem.\n\n\n\n\nvar form = event.target;\nif (!form.checkValidity()) {\n  // form is invalid\n  event.preventDefault();\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out! In the form, click Submit. Nothing happened? That's right. Now add a name and a valid email address and click Submit. Notice that the form submitted. In the next few steps, you will bring back the error messages.\n\n\n\n\nLoop through the fields\n\n\nEvery form has an elements array. You can use that loop through the fields.\n\n\n\n\nCreate the loop above the form validity check.\n\n\n\n\nvar form = event.target;\nvar f;\nfor (f = 0; f \n form.elements.length; f++) {\n\n}\n\nif (!form.checkValidity()) {\n  // form is invalid\n  event.preventDefault();\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the loop, get a reference to the current field. \nvalidateForm\n should now look like:\n\n\n\n\nfunction validateForm(event) {\n  var form = event.target;\n  var f;\n  var field;\n\n  for (f = 0; f \n form.elements.length; f++) {\n\n    // get field\n    field = form.elements[f];\n\n  }\n\n  if (!form.checkValidity()) {\n    // form is invalid\n    event.preventDefault();\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe behavior of the form hasn't changed so charge on to the next section.\n\n\nCheck the field validity\n\n\nYou know you will have custom logic for validating the state field, so use a function to encapsulate all of the field validation logic. Start with using the standard validation logic.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new function \nisValid\n that takes a field as a parameter.\n\n\nLike the form, fields have a \ncheckValidity\n function. Use this function to determine the return value for the function. Here's how it should look:\n\n\n\n\nfunction isValid(field) {\n  return field.checkValidity();\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow call this function from the loop inside the \nvalidateForm\n function.\n\n\n\n\n...\n  for (f = 0; f \n form.elements.length; f++) {\n    // get field\n    field = form.elements[f];\n\n    if(isValid(field)) {\n      // remove error styles and messages\n    } else {\n      // style field, show error, etc.\n    }\n  }\n...\n\n\n\n\nSet and clear error messages\n\n\nNow that you are looping through each field and checking its validity, you can use the information to format the feedback to the user. In the HTML, you may have noticed that below the fields that have validation, there is a \nspan\n element. You will use this element to display feedback to the user.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nsetError\n function that takes a field as a parameter.\n\n\nInside the function, get a reference to the \nspan\n you will use to show the error. To do that, use the handy \nnextElementSibling\n.\n\n\nNow that you have a reference to the element, set its \ninnerHTML\n to the field's \nvalidationMessage\n. The \nvalidationMessage\n is either the default message from the browser or a custom message you set. The finished function should loop like:\n\n\n\n\nfunction setError(field) {\n  var error = field.nextElementSibling;\n  if (error) error.innerHTML = field.validationMessage;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up a similar function to clear the error text. Copy and paste the \nsetError\n function.\n\n\nChange the function name to \nclearError\n.\n\n\nInstead of \nfield.validationMessage\n, set the \ninnerHTML\n to \n''\n. The complete function is:\n\n\n\n\nfunction clearError(field) {\n  var error = field.nextElementSibling;\n  if (error) error.innerHTML = '';\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinish the logic by calling these function from \nvalidateForm\n. If the field is valid, call \nclearError\n and if not call \nsetError\n.\n\n\n\n\n...\n    if (isValid(field)) {\n      // remove error styles and messages\n      clearError(field);\n    } else {\n      // style field, show error, etc.\n      setError(field);\n    }\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out. Click Submit. Do you see the error messages? Do the error messages disappear when you enter valid data?\n\n\n\n\nAs you type in the email field, does the message change? No? What is missing from the \nkeyup\n event listener?\n\n\nAdd custom validation logic to the state field\n\n\nTime for the bonus round! Custom validation logic could involve evaluating multiple fields on the form, making a call to the server, or performing some calculation in a worker thread. While those are beyond the time you have for this workshop, this section will walk you through creating a some custom logic. Keep in mind that there are better ways to enforce the logic presented in the here, but hey, use your imagination. ;-)\n\n\nYou will add this logic to the top of the \nisValid\n function you created earlier.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, check if the field passed to the function is named \nstate\n.\n\n\nIf so, check if the state is in the list of valid states. Valid states include: CA, TX, NY.\n\n\n\n\nfunction isValid(field) {\n  // custom logic for state\n  if (field.name === 'state') {\n    var validStates = ['CA', 'TX', 'NY'];\n    if (validStates.indexOf(field.value) === -1) {\n      // invalid state\n    } else {\n      // valid state\n    }\n  }\n  return field.checkValidity();\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the state is invalid, set a custom validity message. When it is not, set an empty string.\n\n\n\n\n    ...\n    if (validStates.indexOf(field.value) === -1) {\n      // invalid state\n      field.setCustomValidity('Use CA, TX, or NY');\n    } else {\n      // valid state\n      field.setCustomValidity('');\n    }\n    ...\n\n\n\n\nNow when you try to submit without a state or an invalid state, you will get an error message just like with name and email.\n\n\nThat's it for validation! You may now add \"HTML5 constraint validation API\" to your resume.\n\n\nWelcome text with cookies\n\n\nAdding classes to style error message or boxes\n\n\nTest with Mocha\n\n\nHeroku to Publish\n\n\nHeroku\n is a web hosting platform that allows developers to go from code to running apps in minutes.

The DOM is a representation of what is on the page, including the elements and styles.   The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents. It provides a structured representation of the document (a tree) and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once that event is triggered the event handlers get executed. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages. - MDN   One of the trickest things about the DOM is that it's up to the browser vendor to implement it and therefore every implementation is a little different. This is why we get browser compatability issues.  But as you will see there is a large API exposed by the DOM which allows us to craft powerful user experiences. An easy way to think of the DOM is a tree of nested nodes and each node is an element from our HTML document, e.g. a  div ,  p ,  button , etc...  To visualize this all you need to do is open your web inspector and look at the  Elements  tab to see this structure realized.

If you're familiar with a library such as  jQuery  or  Zepto  than you'll be used to doing this by way of the  $()  selector. By selecting an element (DOM node) we get a reference to that element which allows us to take actions on it.  There are several functions we can use to get a reference to a DOM node. Overtime these functions have been introduced to solve different needs. As such, the browser support for them can vary. You should always research browser compatability to ensure they will work for your user base.   querySelector  querySelectorAll  getElementById  getElementsByClassName  getElementsByName  getElementsByTagName   For now, we are going to focus on  querySelector . This function behaves similar to jQuery in that it allows you to specify a  css selector  that will be used to find the first matching node. One of the nice feature of this function is that it is available both on the  document  as well as  element . This means you can search for an element in the entire document or narrow your search to the sub elements of an existing element.  For now, let's just open up the dev console and mess around. We can begin by selecting the input with a name attribute of  name .  var inputName = document.querySelector('input[name= name ]')  This returns us an  HTMLInputElement  which has a  value  property available. Go ahead and set the value property to see an example of how you can change the DOM.  inputName.value = 'My new value!'  You should see the value you set reflected in the form's input.

What does \"add skill\" really mean? We want to duplicate the skill blueprint we have,  skillTemplate  and create another Node just like it. Then, we want to append it at the end of the list of skills.  We can clone any DOM Node with the  cloneNode  method. The  cloneNode  method takes an optional boolean argument to determine whether it should be a deep or shallow clone. Since we want the entire  input-group  element and all of it's children Nodes, we are going to pass a  true  in.  Unfortunately, there is no  appendAfter  method we can use like in jQuery, but there is an  insertBefore  method. We can use  insertBefore  to append the new cloned Node just before the submit button.  The  insertBefore  method uses a handle on the parent node to attach the new Node in the correct spot within the tree. We can use the  parentNode  accesor on any DOM Node to get it's parent, or, since we know the parent is the form we can just directly select it again.  var addSkillButton = document.querySelector('.add-skill')\nvar skillTemplate = document.querySelector('.skills').cloneNode(true)\n\nvar addSkillHandler = function(evt) {\n  var submitNode = document.querySelector('.submit')\n  var parentNode = submitNode.parentNode\n  var newSkill = skillTemplate.cloneNode(true)\n  parentNode.insertBefore(newSkill, submitNode)\n}\naddSkillButton.addEventListener('click', addSkillHandler)  We just grew a branch on our DOM tree \ud83c\udf33! Does it look right, though?   After we clone a new node, we need to change the plus sign to a minus sign on the previous one. If you look at the  public/index.html  you'll see that both the plus and minus icons already exist in the DOM, except that the minus is currently  hidden  with the class  hidden .  In jQuery, you can use the  .last()  method after selecting a group of elements to get the last one. Let's write a helper method that does just that for a given selector.  var last = function(selector) {\n  var all = document.querySelectorAll(selector)\n  var length = all.length\n  return all[length - 1]\n}  Now let's update our  addSkillHandler  method to get a handle on the previous skill, update it to show the minus instead of the plus, and  then  add the new skill to the end of the list.  When we have a handle on the DOM Node as we will with the previous skill, we can get a list of the Node's classes by using the  classList  accessor . We can then use  .add()  and  .remove()  to add and remove classes from this Node.  var addSkillButton = document.querySelector('.add-skill')\nvar skillTemplate = document.querySelector('.skills')\n\nvar addSkillHandler = function(evt) {\n  var prevSkill = last('.skill')\n  var newSkill = skillTemplate.cloneNode(true)\n  var submitNode = document.querySelector('.submit')\n  var parentNode = submitNode.parentNode\n\n  prevSkill.querySelector('.add-skill').classList.add('hidden')\n  prevSkill.querySelector('.remove-skill').classList.remove('hidden')\n  parentNode.insertBefore(newSkill, submitNode)\n}\naddSkillButton.addEventListener('click', addSkillHandler)  If you head over to the browser, it should work! Sweet DOM manipulation.  Did you try to click the second plus button like a smarty pants? Then you realize that it didn't work, right?  Fix it by attaching the handler to the new element as well.  var addSkillButton = document.querySelector('.add-skill')\nvar skillTemplate = document.querySelector('.skills')\n\nvar addSkillHandler = function(evt) {\n  var prevSkill = last('.skill')\n  var newSkill = skillTemplate.cloneNode(true)\n  var submitNode = document.querySelector('.submit')\n  var parentNode = submitNode.parentNode\n\n  prevSkill.querySelector('.add-skill').classList.add('hidden')\n  prevSkill.querySelector('.remove-skill').classList.remove('hidden')\n  newAddSkill.querySelector('.add-skill').addEventListener('click', addSkillHandler)\n\n  parentNode.insertBefore(newSkill, submitNode)\n}\naddSkillButton.addEventListener('click', addSkillHandler)  Great, now you're ready to remove some skills!",

If we have a handle on the minus button, then we can select the  parentNode  to get the group of elements that makes up a single skill. And if we can do that, then we can just call  remove()  do remove the Node from the DOM.  var removeSkillHandler = function(evt) {\n  var skill = evt.currentTarget.parentNode\n  skill.remove()\n}",

Later, we'll use this handler to kick off a request to the backend.  To start create a new file called  main.js  in the app directory.  Our first step in this new file is to get a reference to the form element. Create a variable named  form , and assign the form DOM element on the page to it.  var form = document.querySelector('form')  On the next line create a  submitHandler  function. We will need to have the event passed into the handler available to us so add the parameter  evt  to the function declaration.  var submitHandler = function(evt) {}  We will be using the  preventDefault  method on the event object. This handy method will stop the form from submitting to the backend so that we can submit this information using AJAX.  Let's also throw in an  alert  so that we can see some feedback from the submit handler. Otherwise, when we click on the submit button nothing will happen which can be confusing. Add the two new commands to the submit handler declaration like below.  var submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  alert('submit!')\n}  In order to hook this handler up to our form element, we will need to use the  addEventListener  method that exists on the form node. Pass in the event we want to listen for (submit) as well as the custom handler we just wrote.  form.addEventListener('submit', submitHandler)  Now if you refresh the page you should be able to submit the form after filling out the two required fields, but instead of the page refreshing and losing everything you've entered the page will show you an alert and you won't lose any of the information you typed.

            "text": "Before we can begin to assemble the pieces for talking to our server, we will need to make sure that we can capture the data from our form in a format that our API endpoint can digest. The API for this workshop is built with  rails-api  which will be expecting a JSON API object on the request.  We need to take the form data and convert it to an object that looks like this  {\n   form : {\n     name :  ,\n     email :  ,\n     city :  ,\n     state :  ,\n     github :  ,\n     twitter :  ,\n     bio :  ,\n     skills_attributes : []\n  }\n}  If we were using something like jQuery we may use the  .serializeArray()  method. Let's write our own  serializeArray  method.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {}  We want to be able to pass in our selector for the form to this method and get the JSON object back. First, let's use  document.querySelector  again to grab the form.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n}  ProTip\u2122:   In our example, we know we are passing in a form selector but if you wanted to use this method in a different scenario, you might want to check that the element we have selected is actually a form by using  form.tagName  to check the element's tag name.  Now we need to grab all the inputs from inside the form element. Remember the  querySelectorAll  method mentioned above? While  querySelector  returns a single Node in the DOM,  querySelectorAll  will return a  NodeList .  The unusual thing about this is that  NodeList  is not a JavaScript  Array  and so we cannot use methods like  map  or  forEach  to iterate over the items returned. We could do some fancy work and add these methods to the prototype for  NodeList , but to keep things simple we will just use a basic  for  loop to iterate over them.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input,textarea')\n\n  for (var i = 0; i   formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n  }\n}  Now that we can iterate over them we will need to store the  name  and  value  of each item onto a JSON object as the  key , value  pair. When we are accessing the  Node  directly, we can easily call  node.name  or  node.value  to access these attributes.  We can't test our method unless we call our  serializeArray  method from somewhere, so let's add the call into our  submitHandler  method.  var submitHandler = function(evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault()\n  var data = serializeArray('form')\n}  Ok, now let's build our final  data  JSON object. Let's also log it to the console so that we can inspect it make sure it matches our expected output that we defined above.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input,textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i   formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n    data[item.name] = item.value\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}  When you reload the page and submit the form again, you should see something similar to this outputted in the console.   Well that looks  nearly  correct. Can you spot the problems?  Firstly, we're capturing the submit button. There are a couple ways to avoid this.  We could change the submit button from an  input  to a  div  and change our handler from the  form   submit  event to the  div   onclick  event. If we were to do this, we would lose the native validations, so let's nix this idea.  We could instead just change our  querySelectorAll(...)  selector string to ignore the  type=submit  input. That seems simple enough, so let's add that in.  var serializeArray = function(selector) {\n  var form = document.querySelector(selector)\n  var formInputs = form.querySelectorAll('input:not([type=submit]),textarea')\n\n  // Empty object for us to set key values of inputs\n  var data = {}\n\n  for (var i = 0; i   formInputs.length; i++) {\n    var item = formInputs[i]\n    data[item.name] = item.value\n  }\n\n  // Log out our final object so we can inspect it\n  console.log(data)\n}  Ok, let's try this again!

If it passes those checks, we'll parse the response JSON, then send the object back though a callback.  var xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n  request.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    // ignore anything that isn't the last state\n    if (request.readyState !== 4) { return }\n\n    // if we didn't get a  good  status such as 200 OK or 201 Created send back an error\n    if (request.readyState === 4   (request.status !== 200   request.status !== 201)) {\n      callback(new Error('XHR Failed: ' + path), null)\n    }\n\n    // return our server data\n    callback(null, JSON.parse(request.responseText))\n  }\n}  Lastly just close and send the request with our data using the  send  function.  var xhr = function(method, path, data, callback) {\n  var request = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  request.open(method, path, true)\n  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n  request.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    // ignore anything that isn't the last state\n    if (request.readyState !== 4) { return }\n\n    // if we didn't get a  good  status such as 200 OK or 201 Created send back an error\n    if (request.readyState === 4   (request.status !== 200   request.status !== 201)) {\n      callback(new Error('XHR Failed: ' + path), null)\n    }\n\n    // return our server data\n    callback(null, JSON.parse(request.responseText))\n  }\n  request.send(data)\n}  Now we're ready to use it inside of our  submitHandler . We can call it with the 'POST' method and pass it the form data.  var apiURL = '//sandiegojs-vanilla-workshop.herokuapp.com'\n\nvar submitHandler = function (evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault();\n  var path = apiURL + '/forms'\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) { throw err }\n    console.log(data)\n  })\n}",

        {
            "location": "/#handle-server-response", 
            "text": "Now that we are able to submit the form to the server let's do something with the response. We're going to write any errors from our XHR request to the screen. We're also going to render the contents of the form to the screen if it was successfully submitted.  Some of the methods we'll be using are:   Document.createElement  this method creates a DOM element of the type specified in the first parameter. For example, we can pass in  div ,  p ,  ul , etc.  Document.createTextNode  this method creates a text node that can be placed in the document. We'll use this to hold content we author.  Node.appendChild  this method can be called on any element created using createElement. As you can guess from the name it adds the node passed in to the end of node you call appendChild on.   Let's create a small helper function. It creates a DOM node and adds some text to it. We're going to be making a lot calls to this.  var createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {}  Right inside of that function declaration we should add a call to  document.createElement .   var createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName);\n}  Next up we will create a text node that will hold whatever is inside of the tagContent variable.  var createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName);\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n}  Then we combine the two freshly created nodes. You can add other HTML nodes or text nodes to a node even if the HTML node would usually have children, such as  br .  var createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName);\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n  node.appendChild(textNode)\n}  And lastly we will return the node we created with a child text node.  var createElementWithTextNode = function (tagName, tagContent) {\n  var node = document.createElement(tagName);\n  var textNode = document.createTextNode(tagContent)\n  node.appendChild(textNode)\n  return node\n}  Now that we have that built, we can start to output some content. First create the renderError function  var renderError = function (error) {}  The error render will be very simple. We are going to get a reference to the response container, create a node with our helper function, add a custom class to it, and append it to the document.  var renderError = function (error) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n  var errorNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', error.toString())\n  errorNode.className = 'error'\n  responseNode.appendChild(errorNode)\n}  Now it's time to create the renderFormData function. This function is going to create many DOM nodes and append them to the response container.  var renderFormData = function(data) {}  The first thing we want to do inside of the renderFormData function is get a reference to the response container just like in our  renderError  function", 
            "title": "Handle server response"

        {
            "location": "/#unfinished", 
            "text": "var renderFormData = function (data) {\n  var responseNode = document.querySelector('.response-wrapper')\n\n  //generic success message\n  var successNode = createElementWithTextNode('div', 'You\\'ve add a new card')\n  successNode.className = 'success'\n  responseNode.appendChild(successNode)\n\n  var dictionaryNode = document.createElement('dl')\n  var keys = ['name', 'email', 'github', 'twitter'], node;\n  keys.forEach(function (key) {\n    //create a dom node with the name of a value\n    node = createElementWithTextNode('dt', key)\n    dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n    //create another dom node with the value\n    node = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data[key])\n    dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n  })\n\n  //create a dom node with the name of a value\n  node = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'location')\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n  //create another dom node with the value\n  node = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data['city'] + ', ' + data['state'])\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n  //create a dom node with the name of a value\n  node = createElementWithTextNode('dt', 'bio')\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n  //create another dom node with the value\n  node = createElementWithTextNode('dd', data['bio'])\n  dictionaryNode.appendChild(node)\n\n  dictionaryNode.className = 'response'\n  responseNode.appendChild(dictionaryNode)\n}  Finally, we just call renderError   renderFormData in the appropriate places in the original submitHandler.  var submitHandler = function (evt) {\n  evt.preventDefault();\n  var path = apiURL + '/forms'\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) {\n      renderError(err)\n      throw err\n    }\n    console.log(data)\n    renderFormData(data)\n  })\n}  If you fill out the form, you should see a response similar to what was described in the  Serialize the form data  section. For example:  {\n   id : 1,\n   name :  Testy McTesterson ,\n   email :  test@sandiegojs.org ,\n   city :  San Diego ,\n   state :  CA ,\n   github :  testdev ,\n   twitter :  testtwitter ,\n   bio :  Lorem Ipsum... ,\n   created_at :  2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z ,\n   updated_at :  2016-01-21T07:09:01.640Z \n}  Sometimes, something will go wrong with a request and instead of receiving a new record from the backend we'll get an error of some kind! We already built our xhr function to let us know when something goes wrong during the AJAX request, but now we need to do something to let the user know that there was a problem.  Update the xhr callback inside of the submitHandler function to show the user a generic error message in an alert when the callback receives an error.    ...\n  xhr('POST', path, serializeArray('form'), function(err, data) {\n    if (err) {\n      alert('Oh no! We\\'re sorry, but something went wrong! \\nCheck the console for more details.')\n      throw err\n    }\n    console.log(data)\n  })\n  ...",
